1
00:00:03,795 --> 00:00:06,005
I betrayed my friends.

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,009
I betrayed my friends.

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:19,010
subtitles for the platform @mkdoramas

4
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:38,955
The prisoner's dilemma.

5
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,541
A psychological game where
betrayal makes everyone lose,

6
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:45,587
but working together
benefits everyone.

7
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,609
When I first came here,

8
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,235
I hated you all.

9
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:11,738
That's a fault?

10
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,990
I still hate all of you,
most of the time.

11
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,451
I secretly took photos
of you guys.

12
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,495
Mostly of your delts.

13
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,788
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,333
I'm a pretty good liar.

15
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:29,380
I...
Ages ago...

16
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,848
You're too nice
and that makes me look bad.

17
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,018
And you,
stop acting like a heroine.

18
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,063
Seong Su-ji,
Be nicer when you talk!

19
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,024
And Ja-eun,
don't be so nice when you talk.

20
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,818
Yeah, you need to be shot.

21
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,529
Ji-ae, why are you
suddenly so quiet?

22
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:55,657
-You're the one being too loud.
-Are you dissing me?

23
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,743
-You are a bit loud.
-I think she's funny.

24
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,914
You're smiling?
Stop being so nice.

25
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,207
This is funny?
Why are you smiling?

26
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,543
-Stop smiling.
-Stop firing at me.

27
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,713
Hey!

28
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:22,225
I've racked my brains,
and that's all we've ever done.

29
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,229
What about you?

30
00:02:27,146 --> 00:02:28,356
You know what?

31
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,900
You've been totally
screwed over right now,

32
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,695
and we have finally
become a "we."

33
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,331
Look at her staring.

34
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,750
I feel sorry for her.

35
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,919
Oh no.

36
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,129
Oh no.

37
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,471
Shit, we've been screwed.

38
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,642
Don't just stand there.
Don't you see Ha-rin signaling?

39
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,646
Do you want to see
her flip out again?

40
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,107
Do something.

41
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,276
Pyo Ji-ae.
Come over here.

42
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,611
Shit, come over here!

43
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,155
You think I can't touch you
because you're not an F anymore?

44
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:19,657
-Stop it.
-What?

45
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,243
-Fuck, get out of my way.
-I said, stop it.

46
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,914
You bitches!

47
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,296
Damn you!

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,274
Ja-eun, call 911, now!

49
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,818
Ja-eun, hurry!

50

AUNT

57
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:40,923
Those girls finally
got into major trouble!

58
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,093
So, how badly is she hurt?

59
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:46,971
Okay.

60
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,974
Okay, you idiot!
Just wait. Okay?

61
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,350
I'm hanging up!

62
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,561
MR. IM 2-5

63
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,157
I should've been
more attentive.

64
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,618
I don't need an apology.

65
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,704
Our first priority is to stop
them from talking.

66
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,123
The girls, teachers,
and instructors...

67
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:17,293
-This can't get out.
-Of course.

68
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,921
I'll make sure of that.

69
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,090
When Mr. Kim arrives...

70
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,299
That girl...

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,343
Sim Eun-jeong.

72
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,514
She's a scholarship
student, isn't she?

73
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,103
What the hell happened?

74
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,479
Who beat up who?

75
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,484
Go Eun-byeol.
She set me up, didn't she?

76
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:44,987
She threw me under
the bus, didn't she?

77
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,365
Am I right or not?

78
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,117
You just realized that now?

79
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,285
I'm gonna kill her!

80
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,912
DAD

81
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,914
Don't answer that, damn it!

82
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,083
Where's Baek Ha-rin?
Where is she right now?

83
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,167
Dumbass.

84
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:00,962
Get your head on straight.

85
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,674
You think that bitch
will help you with your father?

86
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,758
Don't kid yourself.

87
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,010
Acting like her maid
was all for nothing.

88
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,679
Get it together!

89
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,266
Do-ah.
What did she just say to me?

90
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:18,062
You're just our
driver's daughter.

91
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,022
You think we're friends because
we let you hang out with us?

92
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,732
Know your place.

93
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,818
Don't act like we're friends.

94
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:27,530
You're nothing but
a servant, Seol-ha.

95
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,408
You do what I tell you!

96
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,617
Got that?

97
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,163
Go get me some alcohol.

98
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,664
Screw you.

99
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,380
Seong Su-ji will win.

100
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,632
What?

101
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:49,510
At least she knows
who's on her side and who isn't.

102
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,681
Yes, Dad?

103
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,104
BS DAD

104
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,406
Things are bad.

105
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,868
Right now, Eun-jeong...

106
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,746
who is not an F,

107
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,040
got beat up by Da-yeon
who isn't an A.

108
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,583
That's not allowed.

109
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,752
So Ha-rin.

110
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:25,254
just hear me out.
I'm saying this for your sake.

111
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:31,010
Why don't you just
do away with the game?

112
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,179
Let's just go with
outright bullying.

113
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,932
Oh. Of course, you would
never bully anyone.

114
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,433
Leave that to us.

115
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,519
To me.

116
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,608
-It has to be the Pyramid Game.
-What?

117
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,827
We're going to play a game today.

118
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,955
If you do well,
you'll get a reward.

119
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,208
But if you don't,
you'll get a penalty.

120
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,965
Having fun?

121
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:10,675
We're playing a game.

122
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,262
It has to be...

123
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,847
the game.

124
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,475
Got that?

125
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,361
Hey, there's Ja-eun.

126
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,655
Ja-eun, come and play!

127
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,575
Ja-eun! Hurry up!

128
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,077
Ja-eun, come on!

129
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,996
Ja-eun, let's play!

130
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,229
I expected as much.
You don't look guilty at all.

131
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,107
-And you're back from the dead.
-I'm only asking, just in case.

132
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,359
You have no intention
of stopping, or feel any remorse,

133
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:11,902
do you?

134
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,738
If you do, even just
a little bit, tell me now.

135
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,864
I'll take it under consideration.

136
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,824
Why are you asking me?

137
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,035
-What?
-Go ask Ja-eun.

138
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,879
Hey...

139
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,560
You don't have anything to wear,
right? I'll lend you mine.

140
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:45,770
Huh?

141
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,563
Geez, put that away.

142
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,899
How is she supposed to fit
into your size zero clothes?

143
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,734
Here, wear mine.

144
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,736
Mine too.

145
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,905
Are you kidding?

146
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,282
You're over 174 cm tall!

147
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,326
Don't you know your own bodies?

148
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,624
Thanks.

149
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,669
Thank you, really.

150
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,719
Come on.
Why is everyone so down?

151
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,804
Yeah!

152
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,014
What's the problem?
Hey, something

153
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,100
The vibe is so chilly

154
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,769
Of course it is.

155
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,313
How is Eun-jeong anyway?

156
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,442
I'm sure she'll call
once the test results are out.

157
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,111
Where's Su-ji?

158
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,571
I think she went out for a sec.

159
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:41,534
So, including Su-ji,
these are the final members?

160
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,911
Wait a sec.

161
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,543
What are they doing here?

162
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:53,129
Did Ha-rin tell you to spy on us?

163
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,172
Or are you just here
to check things out?

164
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,632
That's enough.

165
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,386
They were worried
about Eun-jeong.

166
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:07,268
We'll be choosing an F
among you four.

167
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,561
Who agrees?

168
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,971
Ye-rim. I feel so bad.

169
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,015
I'm sure Eun-jeong
will be alright.

170
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,516
She's got strong bones.

171
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,352
Anyway, you must be
livid with Da-yeon.

172
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,857
Ha-rin and I are on your side.

173
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,194
We think the as should
penalize Da-yeon.

174
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,154
What do you want to do to her?

175
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,406
Tell me anything you want.

176
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,326
Shit, this is what you
wanted to talk about?

177
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,745
This is all I have to say.

178
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:14,627
Then, I'll take it that
you're leaving everything to us.

179
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,420
Don't change your mind later!

180
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,298
What an attention hog.

181
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,054
HA-RIN

182
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,014
Ha-rin, I did what you asked.

183
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,685
Still no word from Eun-jeong?

184
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,729
Her swim coach just got there,

185
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,898
so I'm sure I'll hear
something soon.

186
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,613
Who's that?

187
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,420
Uh...

188
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:43,632
Eun-jeong was moved
to Seosim Hospital in Seoul,

189
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,220
and she'll be getting
surgery there.

190
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,222
You saw what happened,

191
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,057
and I know
I don't have to tell you this,

192
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,851
but don't let your imaginations

193
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,229
go into overdrive and exaggerate
what was only an accident.

194
00:14:57,896 --> 00:14:59,982
Make sure word
of this doesn't get out.

195
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:03,611
A cover up.

196
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,780
It's not something
he could do alone.

197
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,535
Your parents,
the principal...

198
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,414
Most of all,
Eun-jeong's parents

199
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,333
just want to move on quietly.

200
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,501
Do you understand?

201
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,337
Unbelievable.

202
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,505
Fine, extort all
the money you want.

203
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,343
This is why I told you to go
easy on the pranks.

204
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,553
Why are girls' high
schools worse?

205
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,682
Kim Da-yeon.
When we go back to Seoul,

206
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,684
you'll be cleaning the hallway
for two months, got that?

207
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,936
You're not convening a meeting
of the anti-bullying committee?

208
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,857
What?
The anti-bullying committee?

209
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:46,028
Didn't you girls always
say this was just a game?

210
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,366
Seong Su-ji.
Why are you being so dramatic?

211
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,118
An anti-bullying committee?
That's funny.

212
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,459
COACH

213
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,129
Eun-jeong might have to
give up her swimming career.

214
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:07,341
You should come and console her.

215
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:12,221
Clean? Can I make
my housekeeper do it?

216
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,684
What a pain.
Ah...

217
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,478
Why you...
Have you been drinking? Huh?

218
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,230
-You bitch!
-Ye-rim, no.

219
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,940
-Ye-rim!
-You fucking bitch!

220
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:26,527
-This is all on you!
-Shim Eun-jeong's girlfriend.

221
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,612
Let go of me.
She didn't die, did she?

222
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,572
She's alive,
so what more do you want?

223
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:31,907
Let go of me!

224
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:33,409
I only went easy on you
because you're rich.

225
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,451
What, you bitch?

226
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:36,036
Ye-rim.
Jae-hyeong, hold her back.

227
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,454
This is all your fault!

228
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,706
-Jae-hyeong, grab her.
-Stop it!

229
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,748
Im Ye-rim!

230
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,668
You think I won't give out
penalty points on a school trip?

231
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,253
Aren't you going to debut?

232
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,463
Don't you want a
clean student record?

233
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,174
Ye-rim!

234
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,142
Just shut up.

235
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,647
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

236
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,108
Let's start the strip show.

237
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,610
You bitches!

238
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,614
-Ye-rim!
-Don't hold me back!

239
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,950
Let go of me!

240
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,078
Ye-rim, let her go.

241
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:23,041
I'll make sure she pays.

242
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,711
Shit!

243
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,115
This is a message from the As.

244
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,826
Kim Da-yeon will soon be
receiving a penalty.

245
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,220
What?
What are you doing?

246
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,847
What are you doing, huh?

247
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,149
So, you absolutely refuse
to give up the game?

248
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,652
Fine,

249
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:34,071
let's go all the way.

250
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,717
Hey, Eun-jeong. I'm here.

251
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,179
-Hello.
-Hi.

252
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,640
Are you okay?

253
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,851
You look comfy.

254
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:06,311
Have you eaten
anything yet, ma'am?

255
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,647
It's my fault again...

256
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,694
It's my fault...

257
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,216
MISSED CALL
MOM

258
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,096
Ja-eun,
you must be busy.

259
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:42,931
Are you back in Seoul?

260
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,897
A friend got hurt
because of me.

261
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,274
I'm scared.

262
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,985
I'm miserable, Mom.

263
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,840
STUDY PERIOD

264
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,702
BAEK HA-RIN

265
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,079
GO EUN-BYEOL

266
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,417
CHOI YU-HYUN

267
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,502
YANG SO-YOUNG

268
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,182
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU COULD
DO ANONYMOUSLY, WOULD YOU?

269
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,734
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU COULD
DO ANONYMOUSLY, WOULD YOU?

270
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,862
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU COULD
DO ANONYMOUSLY, WOULD YOU?

271
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,572
IF THERE WAS SOMETHING YOU COULD
DO ANONYMOUSLY, WOULD YOU?

272
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,310
I heard rumors
about class 2-5.

273
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,645
The special class?
What kind of rumors?

274
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,564
Finals are coming up.

275
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,399
Let's study, girls.

276
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,609
You teenagers.

277
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,528
Don't you want to go to college?

278
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,988
You know that girl? The reserve
on the national swim team?

279
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,031
Sim Eun-jeong?

280
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,575
I heard Kim Da-yeon beat
her up and blew her knee out.

281
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,539
SIM EUN-JEONG

282
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,915
THE FUTURE OF THE
KOREAN SWIM TEAM,

283
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,459
TRAINING ON THE NATIONAL
TEAM RESERVES...

284
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,714
Are the adults blocking
all the articles?

285
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,051
That girl's family is a mess.

286
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,803
QB's legal team
provided adequate compensation,

287
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,555
and told them
to keep quiet about it.

288
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,807
There are no problems with
the girls at your school, right?

289
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,435
Do-ah, try to keep Ha-rin
in check for a while.

290
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,519
Dad.

291
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:37,773
Blocking all the articles
is pretty useless at this point.

292
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,107
What do you mean?

293
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,822
There's a messenger app
that all the kids use these days.

294
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,365
Everyone's talking about how

295
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,785
a reserve on the national
swim team got bullied.

296
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,455
Word got around on social media,
hashtag, KDY.

297
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:55,582
Kim Da-yeon.

298
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,502
Hold on a sec.

299
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,798
Hello?

300
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,924
Oh, yes.

301
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,177
DO-AH

302
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,804
Yesterday?

303
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,764
Yes.

304
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,610
I have hard evidence.

305
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,155
Tell the Chairman
you want to go abroad.

306
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,628
Evidence of my embezzlement?
You can break the story wide up.

307
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,214
I'm her son.

308
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,925
That game you play?
You're not a child anymore.

309
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,552
How dare you bring the
Baekyeon name into it?

310
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,887
You know what
grandma often says to you?

311
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,931
"You fool."

312
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:54,683
You fool.

313
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,184
The proof of
your embezzlement

314
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,353
isn't the ticking
time bomb, it's me.

315
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,106
Do you not understand?

316
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,026
Don't mess

317
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,028
with me.

318
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,750
Honey.
I just talked to Director Seo.

319
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,215
What's wrong?

320
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,219
STUDY PERIOD
FINALS ARE HERE!!!

321
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,763
Like we said,
the As have reached a decision

322
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,516
on how to punish
B rank Kim Da-yeon

323
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,269
for assaulting
D rank Sim Eun-jeong

324
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,146
during the school trip.

325
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,024
Starting today

326
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:45,817
Kim Da-yeon

327
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:47,986
has no rank.

328
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,406
No rank means...

329
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,205
Kim Da-yeon.

330
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,081
Step out.

331
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,044
Didn't you hear me?

332
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,462
Step out, now!

333
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,548
You're being transferred out.

334
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,634
What the fuck?

335
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,969
They can't do this to me!

336
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,638
Fuck!

337
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,601
Fuck!
Shit!

338
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,774
Nice going.

339
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:26,900
Keep at it.

340
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,696
Sit, you brat.

341
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,448
Fuck off.

342
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,451
I'm your teacher!

343
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,455
I'm trying to help.

344
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,793
How much can your father pay?

345
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:48,338
You'll have to transfer out,
but depending on the amount,

346
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:49,589
I can make you look
like the victim

347
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,007
in all of this at
your new school.

348
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,969
What do you say?
You want to talk to your father?

349
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,515
You little bitch!

350
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,808
Stand up straight!

351
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:03,353
Woah.

352
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,776
Uh, sir...

353
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,779
You ruin everything.

354
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,614
You know that?
Shit!

355
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,616
-She has to transfer out?
-Kim Da-yeon?

356
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,994
I don't believe it. Wow.

357
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,662
What does it mean?

358
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,747
Did they acknowledge
it was bullying?

359
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:46,187
CLOSE ACCOUNT

360
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,315
Tap this
and the account blows up.

361
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,692
It'll be untraceable.
Easy, right?

362
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,362
Oh, and the IDs and passwords
you asked me to make.

363
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,200
IDS
PASSWORDS

364
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,202
Thank you.
I'll hand it out to the others.

365
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:04,497
You're going to have them
spread the rumors here?

366
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,376
-What is this, folklore?
-Well, the finals do cover that.

367
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,588
But those adults only know
how to block articles.

368
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,299
Social media is
out of their scope.

369
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,509
I'm impressed.

370
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,511
Brainy Smurf.

371
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,222
I should go.

372
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,531
Thanks.

373
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,507
That face...

374
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,511
I've seen it before.

375
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,765
Ja-eun, what's going on?

376
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,071
Bring Da-yeon back.

377
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:22,992
#BAEKYEON GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
BULLYING #, #BYGH BULLYING

378
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,911
No, you stay low

379
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,664
and go back to class.

380
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,957
I want Da-yeon back.

381
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,625
Then you should've done
a better job.

382
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,128
You did this to yourself.
Don't take it out on me.

383
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,256
-You're not a child anymore.
-I told you not to mess with me.

384
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,384
I told you not to
mess with my game!

385
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:50,979
You came.

386
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,441
I told her.

387
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,985
Since she cares
about you so much.

388
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,821
What did you decide to do?

389
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,115
The articles went
out this morning.

390
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,075
BAEKYEON GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

391
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,743
A PRANK, NOT BULLYING,
BUT DEALT WITH SEVERELY

392
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,580
What do you think your job is?

393
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,998
I'm sorry.

394
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,961
-Ha-rin.
-Yes.

395
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,843
School

396
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:26,014
is the best place to hone your
skills to set you up for life.

397
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:28,349
Survival.

398
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,726
Leadership.

399
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,020
The habit of being on top!

400
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,485
My precious baby.

401
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,571
I'm going to give you

402
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:46,201
everything you want.

403
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,537
That is...

404
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:53,041
As long as you don't act foolish.

405
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:57,879
Now, go to class.

406
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:08,181
It's so good.

407
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,225
By the way, Kim Da-yeon...

408
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,144
I guess being transferred out
counts as justice?

409
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,939
Baek Ha-rin is still left...

410
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,066
Oh...

411
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,403
Three girls helped
out anonymously.

412
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,239
Oh Seong-ah,
Yoon Ye-won, Cho Yu-rim.

413
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,491
But we need more girls
to destroy the game.

414
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,578
Also, wait a little longer
for the recording files.

415
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,789
I'm trying to find a way.

416
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,083
I'll do anything to help too.

417
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,212
By the way, I can't believe

418
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,464
we're finally eating malatang
together as a fam.

419
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,091
I'm so touched.

420
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,970
Since when
did this spicy dish

421
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,138
become a symbol of friendship?

422
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,933
And if it's friendship,
where's Ja-eun?

423
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:52,850
Where's Ye-rim?

424
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,435
Ye-rim had to go to
the practice studio.

425
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,855
I never imagined
I'd be in the same fam as Ye-rim.

426
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,651
Ja-eun went home
because she wasn't hungry.

427
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:02,735
Hmph.

428
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,987
Why did she lose her appetite

429
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:05,446
when even Ye-rim
is staying strong?

430
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,282
Always going overboard.

431
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,409
How adorable.

432
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,411
Going overboard?

433
00:31:11,869 --> 00:31:13,538
No, that face...

434
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,790
It was guilt.

435
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,417
This place is really good.

436
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,793
A LIEUTENANT COLONEL USES

437
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,629
CONNECTIONS
TO HOLD MILITARY EVENT?

438
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:10,345
MOM

439
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,145
Hello?

440
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:22,607
So-eun told me everything.

441
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:25,068
Did you...

442
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,737
Did you really

443
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,198
do that to a friend?

444
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:33,117
Is it true?

445
00:32:34,952 --> 00:32:36,496
I'm sorry.

446
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,753
I'm so sorry.

447
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,549
I'm so sorry.

448
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:13,574
Mom...

449
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,760
Why are your eyes all puffy?

450
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,931
Leave me alone.

451
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,308
What?

452
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,992
Hey, Ha-rin.

453
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,343
Woah, things have been so crazy...

454
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,470
However,

455
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,140
even if I forgot about it,

456
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,391
how could you?

457
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,809
Class rep,

458
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,811
aren't you going to
take the finals or not?

459
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,396
What's going on with you?

460
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,857
Move your desks
into single files, now!

461
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,317
Do Mi-yeong, Song Jae-hyeong.

462
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,986
Move the desks on either
end closer to the windows.

463
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:33,905
Now.

464
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,053
SIM EUN-JEONG
GOOD LUCK ON YOUR TESTS

465
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,055
Good luck on your tests.

466
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,852
1ST PERIOD MATH 2, 2ND PERIOD
LITERATURE, 3RD PERIOD PE

467
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,187
No cheating.

468
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:33,923
Any questions?

469
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,092
Question 17
was suddenly added, wasn't it?

470
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:37,552
Question 17?

471
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,891
Question 5 is three.

472
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,685
Six is one.

473
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,812
-One?
-Yes! Three is two.

474
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:49,647
-Question three is two?
-Four is one.

475
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:50,940
Five is one.

476
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,235
Seo Do-ah.
What's the answer to question 17?

477
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:55,444
One.

478
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,904
Shit...

479
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,077
Keep it up a little
longer, girls.

480
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,579
It's the festival after the tests.

481
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,414
Good luck on your next test.

482
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,172
-One is four.
-Four?

483
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,716
Five is two.

484
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,431
Trigonometrical function?
I know.

485
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:27,143
It's not sine, cosine.
No?

486
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,061
Yeon-du always
gets good grades, right?

487
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,856
I think she was in the 2nd rank
for mid-terms.

488
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,669
Hey, where's Ja-eun?

489
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,130
Oh, she's not here?

490
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:58,633
Maybe she went home already?

491
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,154
Leave me alone.

492
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,003
Here you go.

493
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,714
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

494
00:37:49,266 --> 00:37:50,601
Looks like you'd
rather have some soju.

495
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,852
Do you have some?

496
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,397
It's 50 million won.
A special price for minors.

497
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,234
What's wrong?

498
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:02,530
Ja-eun is putting up a wall,
all of a sudden.

499
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,950
Hm...

500
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,706
Forget Su-ji
and work with me.

501
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:14,875
How about it?
Su-ji is a total psycho.

502
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,253
Her ability to relate
is non-existent.

503
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:19,046
Do you know this voice?

504
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,048
Park Ji-young.

505
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,134
...friends with you, Ja-eun.

506
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:26,554
Ja-eun? Don't tell me you
secretly planted...

507
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,681
Don't say that about my friend.

508
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,182
Su-ji is awesome.

509
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,935
I envy her for it
and she's a good friend.

510
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,146
I know all about you, Ji-young.

511
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,647
You're Ha-rin's spy.

512
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,151
Get... Get lost.

513
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,196
You don't sell alcohol to minors

514
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,657
but you plant a recording app
on their phones?

515
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,700
Are you nuts?

516
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,660
I have one of Ha-rin too.
She went to see Ja-eun.

517
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,164
If you listen to it,
that makes us accomplices.

518
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,290
Deal?

519
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,546
Deal.

520
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,257
Wow, shouldn't you say

521
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,633
"I don't have to listen.
I believe in her"

522
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:05,801
for it to be true friendship?

523
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:06,927
How can I believe
without listening?

524
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,637
That's so like you.

525
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,515
Oh, before that...

526
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,268
Look at this first.

527
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,482
A LIEUTENANT COLONEL USES

528
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,941
CONNECTIONS TO HOLD
MILITARY EVENT?

529
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,756
Any witnesses?

530
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:47,718
Crazy bastards. At the
barracks of all places, damn it.

531
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,972
No, don't report
it to the higher-ups!

532
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,307
Keep your mouth shut.

533
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,475
It wasn't assault.

534
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:56,936
It's still an accident for now.

535
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,150
Ye-won, want some?

536
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,152
Hey, Ja-eun.

537
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,987
Can you get my earphones
by your feet?

538
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,339
Ja-eun, let's go get some snacks.

539
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:27,091
They still have
some melon buns left.

540
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,429
This is on Su-ji.

541
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,558
Ja-eun, if you ruin my pyramid...

542
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:39,603
That moron.

543
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:45,192
I'm going to make
Su-ji the bully.

544
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:49,655
What I do will be much worse
than what you did to Da-yeon.

545
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,199
What?

546
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,534
Wherever she goes,

547
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,536
whatever she does,
or whoever she meets,

548
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,038
I'll make sure everyone
knows she's a bully

549
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,582
for the rest of her life.

550
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,751
Is that what you want?

551
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:06,088
Don't.
Don't do this, please.

552
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,549
Then, turn your back on her
and go back to being an F.

553
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,177
Go back to your place.

554
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,560
If you do,
I'll leave the other girls alone.

555
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,105
Please, Ja-eun.

556
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,318
You owe me.

557
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:30,446
Don't you agree?

558
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,247
I...

559
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,834
I...

560
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,546
I'll go back to being the F.

561
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,349
Ja-eun will be really moody

562
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:01,477
for a while.

563
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,645
Give her some time.

564
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,563
What? Why?
What's going on?

565
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,773
It's okay with me.

566
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,775
So, what's the next
step of our plan?

567
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,113
The girls have put up
with this insane game

568
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,406
for a year and a half.

569
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,617
They'll have realized
Ha-rin is starting to crack,

570
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,244
and that we've become a team.

571
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,536
Let's use that.

572
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:20,913
Huh?

573
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:28,504
You know how I said
I'd destroy the game?

574
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,466
But I can't do it alone.

575
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,135
Will you help, Shin-ye?

576
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,807
Let's become safe, together.
All of us.

577
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,437
Hi, Shin-ye.

578
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,106
Hi.

579
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,452
What about Yeon-du?

580
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,997
She hangs out with Ye-rim.
Won't she come over to us?

581
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,418
It's not sine, cosine.
No?

582
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,003
She's on hold for now.

583
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,421
There's something
bothering me about her.

584
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:11,964
Oh...

585
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,011
If this fails, I'll become the F.

586
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,764
But I won't fail.
Will you join us?

587
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,144
RA HAE-JUN

588
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,026
I'm in.

589
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,862
Just promise
this won't get back to me.

590
00:44:07,144 --> 00:44:08,520
Ja-eun,

591
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:16,362
whatever Ha-rin did,
I'm not scared this time.

592
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:19,573
Let's be friends.

593
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,581
This...

594
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:31,085
was what I wanted
to hear the most

595
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,128
when I was the F.

596
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,757
Think long and hard, Ja-eun.

597
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,804
We're friends, aren't we?

598
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,972
Hey, where's Ja-eun?

599
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,557
She's a part of
your fam, isn't she?

600
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,435
Something came up at home.

601
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,230
I'm curious.

602
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:36,483
Why didn't you tell anyone
about this sooner?

603
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,614
I'm not judging you.

604
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,117
But even if it was a game,

605
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,828
you must've realized at
some point this wasn't right.

606
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,664
This is bullying.

607
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,171
Because,

608
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,384
we weren't free
from blame either.

609
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:04,595
And up until now,

610
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:07,556
we were left alone.

611
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:11,143
And we were safe
as long as we weren't the F,

612
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,021
if we're being totally honest.

613
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,277
Yeah. I would've
done the same thing.

614
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,115
On the day of the game,
there will be 13 of us.

615
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,909
I'm reaching out to
a few more girls.

616
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:27,993
Thirteen?

617
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:29,703
What happens then?

618
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:34,291
We'll be the majority, and
we'll give up playing the game.

619
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,627
Give up?

620
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,838
-How?
-They've always stressed the fact

621
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,757
that this game
is played by all of us,

622
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:43,383
but if that is no
longer the case,

623
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,760
the game becomes invalid.

624
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,389
We have to trust each other
for this strategy to work.

625
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,601
It's not Su-ji's usual way
of winning at all.

626
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,603
That's what
I was gonna say, jinx!

627
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,147
Hey, hang on...

628
00:46:57,564 --> 00:47:00,359
-This feels like...
-You're right.

629
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,444
I would never
have thought of this

630
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:04,196
if it weren't for
a certain moron.

631
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:05,864
I'll...

632
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,618
go back to being the F.

633
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,589
SIM EUN-JEONG

634
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:08,135
Shit!

635
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:14,641
YE-RIM, YOU WILL BE PERFORMING
WITH YOUR MEMBERS

636
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:17,102
AT BAEKYEON GIRLS'
HIGH SCHOOL FESTIVAL!

637
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,823
It's not the same one
as last time, right?

638
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,366
It's a different one.

639
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,161
All you have to do is put it
in place, then turn it on.

640
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,496
Will you be okay?

641
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,041
You heard the recording,
didn't you?

642
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,294
It's not enough
just to end the game.

643
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,172
We have to bring Ha-rin down too.

644
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,008
That's why we need this.

645
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:52,346
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

646
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,558
D-DAY

647
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,196
The last Thursday of every month.

648
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:12,699
The day of the Pyramid Game.

649
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:21,124
LOOK FORWARD TO THE SURPRISE
GUEST. BAEKYEON FESTIVAL

650
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,673
Ja-eun!
Huh? Ja-eun!

651
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:28,757
Hey!

652
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,553
-Don't act like we're friends.
-What's going on?

653
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,889
Why did my heart just race?

654
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,226
A Maltese is pretending
to be a Dobermann.

655
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,062
I love it.

656
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,356
Ja-eun, glare at me again.

657
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,274
Are you...

658
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,492
Did you see that?

659
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,995
She's so cool.

660
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,499
What's gotten into her though?

661
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,918
She's gone back
to being her old self.

662
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,670
Did she bomb her test?

663
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:10,799
You don't know
her at all, do you?

664
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:14,302
She never got good grades
in the first place.

665
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:17,931
Hurry.

666

Everything's set.

Where's Su-ji and Ye-rim?

684
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,826
You're not even looking for me?

685
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:08,662
I'm still a part of this class.

Go inside.

Go to your classrooms.

00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,396
Oh no. What happened?

690
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,357
-Oh no.
-Oh no.

691
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,081
