00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,615
You look like
your plan has been exposed.

7
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,909
There was a leak.

8
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,455
SEONG SU-JI

9
00:00:59,058 --> 00:01:01,144
Oh?
What are you two doing here?

10
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,109
Waiting for you.

11
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,488
-What?
-Ye-won told me.

12
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,324
Ye-won.

13
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,828
-Can you do me a favor?
-A favor?

14
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:20,997
What is it?

15
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,751
If Su-ji starts making you feel
uncomfortable, will you tell me?

16
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,961
I heard you were
making her feel uncomfortable.

17
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,505
She came to me

18
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,882
saying that you'd been asking
a lot of questions.

19
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,301
And that Ja-eun was suddenly
following her around.

20
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,846
The Ja-eun I know would
never do something like that.

21
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,932
Did you make her do it?

22
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:42,852
Oh, I just wanted to be
friends with Ye-won.

23
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,604
Ja-eun, you too?

24
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:48,066
Anyway, I hear you.
I made her uncomfortable.

25
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,442
I see...

26
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,195
I know you're behind this.

27
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,240
Su-ji.

28
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,991
Do you want to sit next to me?

29
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:00,620
I think I'd be a better friend
than Ja-eun.

30
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:03,540
All of a sudden?

31
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,875
No, thanks.
I like sitting in the back.

32
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:07,460
You do?

33
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,878
Oh well.

34
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:25,311
So, this is the real you?
The real Baek Ha-rin.

35
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,772
You smoke?

36
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,067
Yeah, there are no cameras here,

37
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,069
and no one comes back here either.

38
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,864
You don't want to be
friends with me, do you?

39
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,329
How much do you know
about Ja-eun?

40
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,248
What about Ji-ae?

41
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,667
Do you really believe they're
the girls you think they are?

42
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,505
What do you mean?

43
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,216
Oh, is this about when I said
I'd be hanging out with them?

44
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,968
That was a low point in my life.
Can you just forget it?

45
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,761
I'm a C now, so why should I?

46
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,471
So lame.

47
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,607
Can you put that out?

48
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,942
I hate second hand smoking.

49
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,944
And how exactly do
I think about them?

50
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,947
Dumb chess pieces
that move according to your plan.

51
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:19,949
I'm sure that's what you thought
about Ye-won too.

52
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,285
But you're wrong, Su-ji.

53
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,294
You'll find out soon enough.

I don't know about you guys,

but if this goes
wrong for me, I'll die.

64
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,317
She doesn't know
anything specific.

65
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,152
Just that we've been
trying to approach Ye-won.

66
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,279
That's practically
the whole plan.

67
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,365
You acted like
you were so meticulous.

68
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:44,951
I'm totally
disappointed in you, Su-ji.

69
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,412
Oh no.

70
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,706
Now what?

71
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,958
I've reached my limit.

72
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,710
You're no longer Fs
so you don't know how I feel...

73
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,212
It's been going on for a year.

74
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,463
They instinctively know

75
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,717
that Ha-rin has more to offer
than we do.

76
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:04,470
What do we do now?
Do we just give up?

77
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,097
We have to come
up with another way.

78
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,724
How?

79
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,575
-Mr. Im.
-Yes?

80
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,328
I'd like to talk to
the girls in class five.

81
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,080
If that's alright...

82
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,166
Why?
Are they in trouble?

83
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,793
Oh, no. It's nothing like that.

84
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,338
They're teenage girls.

85
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,299
I thought they'd be
more comfortable

86
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,426
sharing things with
a female teacher...

87
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:47,430
The problem is
they share too much.

88
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:50,308
I cover up so much for them

89
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:53,144
but they can't even show
their appreciation.

90
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,771
Excuse me?

91
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,446
Hey, F!

92
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,156
Where do you think you're going?

93
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,840
-What do you want?
-I'm sorry.

94
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,554
Ji-ae.

95
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,140
I've been wanting to talk to you.

96
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,018
I know this is rough on you.

97
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:38,815
But what's going on
with you and Su-ji?

98
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,275
Even from a distance,
I can tell she's trouble.

99
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:46,197
You two and Ja-eun
aren't up to something, are you?

100
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,783
What do you care?

101
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,077
Also...

102
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:53,704
Don't badmouth my friend.

103
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,997
Wait, hang on.

104
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,166
Are you really on her side now?

105
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,504
Are you sure
you can trust her?

106
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,645
It's a vitamin.

107
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,858
-Do you want one?
-Huh? No...

108
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:24,944
I did what you asked.

109
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,404

-Because it ruined my plan.

What's up?

124
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,982
Hey, Ye-rim. I entered a contest
sponsored by your foundation.

125
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,817
Could you maybe pull some strings?

126
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,486
Ha-rin, you know that
Ye-rim likes my paintings, right?

00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,992
Hey, Bang Wu-ie.

128
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,327
I'm just kidding.

129
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,497
I know Ye-rim doesn't like
talking about her family.

130
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,251
I like that color on your lips.

131
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:47,670
I've never seen you
wearing make-up before.

132
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,260
-Damn it.
-Why'd that get on my lips?

133
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,846
Yeah.

134
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,640
I wonder why?

135
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,353
What? You want me
to get some on you too?

136
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:05,438
No.

137
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,856

00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:07,982

Okay, fine, fine.

00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:11,152

-Stop, stop, Ye-rim.

141
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,486
-Pucker your lips.
-Stop.

142
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,905

Not really.

147
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,042
No, I have to be careful.

148
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,753
We're down one.

149
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,881
We need at least one
of them on our side.

150
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,219
No, not Seung-ie.

151
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,806
What about Cho Yu-rim?

152
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,892
What's wrong with her?

153
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,937
She ate two bowls.

154
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,731
Hey.

155
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,608
-What about you?
-Me too. Two bowls.

156
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,276
Let's share ice cream.

157
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,278
Damn it!

158
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,077
Hey, get your stomach
out of the way.

159
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,287
Is your body shaped like a
D because your rank is D?

160
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,290
Look at this belly fat.
It's disgusting.

161
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,168
Oh, sorry.

162
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,046
Fuck this.

163
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,301
Wu-ie, don't you think
you're being too harsh?

164
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,137
She bumped into you
by mistake.

165
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,766
Ha-jun,
did you forget my rank?

166
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,311
You're not an A.

167
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,438
And neither Shin-ye or I am an F

168
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,941
I'm just asking you
not to swear so much.

169
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,609
Yeah.

170
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,948
Why is discipline
getting so slack?

171
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,408
It's totally pissing me off.

172
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,076
Do you think my rank
is any different

173
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,787
from Da-yeon's or
Do-ah's? Fuck...

174
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,248
Ha-rin!

175
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,296
Hae-jun is right,
don't you think?

176
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,801
Be more careful, Wu-ie.
This isn't a good look for you.

177
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,178
What?

178
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,151
We used to be friends.

179
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,986
Cho Yu-rim and you?

180
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,655
Oh, yeah.
You two were the only

181
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,490
new girls when
junior year started.

182
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:22,950
Hey.

183
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,453
But you became an F
right away after that.

184
00:12:26,745 --> 00:12:29,039
Then, Yu-rim betrayed you?

185
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,417
Oh my god.

186
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,636
Why did they suddenly
join this class?

187
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,639
It means that Ha-rin
chose them specifically.

188
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,849
But why?

189
00:12:57,401 --> 00:12:59,612
Did you know Ha-rin before?

190
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,822
She handpicked everyone here.

191
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,283
I wonder why she chose you
and Yu-rim to be in this class...

192
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,831
Looking for someone?

193
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,667
Could it be... me?

194
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,337
I'm hurt, you know.

195
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,214
Are you avoiding me?

196
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,467
I'm sorry!

197
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,594
I'm sorry, Da-yeon!

198
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,449
How much do you know
about Ja-eun?

199
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,994
9 YEARS AGO

200
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,958
Green light, red light.

201
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,753
Green light...

202
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,929
Better not let me catch you!

203
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,312
Do you have a fever?

204
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:17,231
What do you know about dating?

205
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,318
Hang on.

206
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,612
Send it to me.

207
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,534
Looks like
you're close with Seol-ha.

208
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:31,203
I'm closer with you.

209
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,498
My dad wants to invite you over.

210
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,958
Do you have time next week?

211
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,211
Sorry.
I'm busy that day.

212
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,385
-I didn't say which day.
-I know.

213
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:03,819
Let's go.

214
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,696
You return the bike.

215
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,992
What am I going to tell my dad?

216
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,786
Damn it.

217
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,337
BAEKYEON GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

218
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:37,645
I'm back.

219
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,124
SEOSIM HOSPITAL

220
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,963
So, did things get awkward
with Da-yeon's dad?

221
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,383
You know it's not just
about the school board.

222
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,427
You get to network
with Baekyeon Group.

223
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,012
He knows that

224
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,140
and that's why he's livid
thinking I took his spot.

225
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:17,976
How are things at school?

226
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,147
The class atmosphere has changed
ever since a new girl named Su-ji

227
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,651
transferred in.

228
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,033
Dr. Yang's daughter
is in your class, right?

229
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,495
Do you know what the difference
is between Dr. Yang and me?

230
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,666
He doesn't have a family business
to pass on to his children,

231
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,211
but I can pass on the ownership
of this hospital to you.

232
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,630
That makes us bourgeois.

233
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,425
Just because you live inside
the same castle

234
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,427
doesn't make
everyone an aristocrat.

235
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,345
There should be a distinction.

236
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,931
All you need to care
about is Ha-rin.

237
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,436
Don't worry.

238
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,909
We'll put Yu-rim on hold for now.

239
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,495
This is our new target.

240
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:20,622
-Hae-jun?
-Ra Hae-jun.

241
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,207
She acts like she traded votes

242
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,751
with the girls
she hangs out with,

243
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,627
but she didn't actually
vote for them.

244
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:27,796
Huh? Why not?

245
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,550
Why did you do it?
Insecurity? Anxiety?

246
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,385
She was probably worried that

247
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,221
her friends would
rank higher than her.

248
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,149
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

249
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,703
I texted her.

250
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:01,872
Hae-jun will be in contact soon.

251
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,627
PARENTS' DAY DATE &amp; LOCATION

252
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,088
Parents's Day?
At our age? That's so lame.

253
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,967
Yeah,
they did it last year too.

254
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,720
I only have a mom

255
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,264
and she doesn't live in Seoul
so she can't come.

256
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,351
-What about you?
-Probably not.

257
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,687
-Both of them?
-I only have a dad.

258
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,189
Oh, more importantly,

259
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,899
getting to a higher
rank starts now.

260
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,276
We need more info on our next
targets, more than Hae-jun...

261
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,528
What are you guys
talking about?

262
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,914
I noticed Ji-ae
was crying alone in the restroom.

263
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,334
Su-ji.

264
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,837
What exactly is going
on in your class?

265
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,630
Let me help.

266
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,383
I think I'll be able to help you.

267
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:57,052
Let the adults handle it.

268
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,099
If a problem arises,

269
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,394
work it out and get through
it instead of trying to avoid it.

270
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,688
What can you do?

271
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,356
I'll notify the school,

272
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:10,983
and call for a meeting
of the anti-bullying committee.

273
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,069
The bullies will be punished
according to procedure...

274
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,822
Oh, I see.
I'll just handle it.

275
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:19,283
Thank you for your concern.

276
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,580
This is serious.

277
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,420
BULLYING CONTINUES
IF YOU LOOK AWAY

278
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:37,259
REPORT BULLYING 117
SUICIDE HOTLINE 1393

279
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,929
Another poster?

280
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,932
We'll have to put it up again.
What a pain.

281
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:45,767
I appreciate it, Ms. Yun.

282
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,981
This is the junior
teachers' office.

283
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,649
Oh, ma'am.

284
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,527
Seong Su-ji's guardian?

285
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,449
LIEUTENANT COLONEL
SEONG HEE-SEOK

BAEKYEON GROUP'S MENTORING
PROGRAM FOR YOUNG SOLDIERS

288
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:16,048
This is Lieutenant Colonel
Seong Hee-seok of Unit 6694.

289
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,592
Is this Seong Su-ji's father?

290
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:20,135
And who am I speaking to?

291
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,137
I hope all is well
with your family.

292
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,181
I'm the principal
of Baekeon Girls' High School.

293
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,474
The principal?

294
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,601
I apologize for calling
out of the blue.

295
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:33,273
You've received the notice sent
from our school, right?

296
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,653
I would very much appreciate it
if you could attend.

297
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,321
BAEKEON GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

298
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,747
NOTICE FOR PARENTS' DAY

299
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:55,087
Pyo Ji-ae!

300
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,758
What were you thinking? Why are
you bringing a teacher into this?

301
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,051
Well...

302
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:04,513
-She came up to me and asked.
-Su-ji, just calm down...

303
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,932
You know the plan.
Do you want to ruin everything?

304
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,273
Are things even
going according to plan?

305
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,901
-What?
-If it is, just say so.

306
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:19,903
I've been wanting to ask anyway.

307
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,365
How can you be just
like the other kids?

308
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,368
Do you even care that
I'm being bullied?

309
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,791
-Did you?
-Su-ji.

310
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:33,917
I told you.

311
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,086
We've both been bullied
just as much as you have.

312
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,879
Is it so hard to just trust me
and wait?

313
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,965
Yes, it's hard!

314
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,010
I can't trust anyone,
and I hate being at school.

315
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,387
It feels like no one
is on my side.

316
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,848
I have nightmares
every day.

317
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,309
When I open my eyes in the
morning, I just want to die!

318
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,523
So?

319
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,400
Am I your mother?

320
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,819
Are we bots you
can vent feelings to?

321
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,112
Don't delude yourself.

322
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,823
The only thing we have
in common is our goal.

323
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,324
Even so, I trust you.

324
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,161
Why? Because you're
both so dependable?

325
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,078
No.

326
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,248
Because without trust,
the whole plan fails.

327
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,834
I figured you'd know that.

328
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,252
I...

329
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,004
am not like you.

330
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,466
I'm not as strong as you are
and I'm a coward.

331
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,014
I really thought
you were my friends.

332
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,809
That's why I feel so hurt,
because we're friends.

333
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,728
Friends?

334
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,982
You've been looking down
on us all this time.

335
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,609
What? When did I do that?

336
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,944
"You're an F.
You rank below us."

337
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,946
"Don't you remember?"

338
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,949
You're an F.
You rank below us.

339
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,162
Yeah, I'm sure you thought
it was okay back then.

340
00:22:52,454 --> 00:22:54,581
It's what everyone was doing.

341
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,166
Is that why

342
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,960
you thought you could still
treat us like that?

343
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,130
If you really thought of
Ja-eun and me as your friends,

344
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,051
you would've apologized
for it first.

345
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,940
Let her go.

346
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,278
RA HAE-JUN

347
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,989
What do you think you're doing?

348
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,032
Why are you bullshitting me?

349
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,827
-Do you have proof that I did it?
-Yes, I do.

350
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,663
I'm sure your friends know

351
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,832
your handwriting.

352
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,584
I heard
you used to be a C before.

353
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,503
But you purposely
went down a rank

354
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,004
to hang out with your friends.

355
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,882
Your friends think you're loyal
and that you look out for them.

356
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,510
Why? It's okay for you to be a D,

357
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,138
but you don't want anyone else
other than you moving up a rank?

358
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,725
If you don't want your friends to
know that you betrayed them,

359
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,019
you better cooperate
with us, Hae-jun.

360
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:00,772
What are you staring at?

361
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,692
Hey! She's not an F anymore.
Watch it.

362
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:06,695
Ja-eun and I
aren't below you.

363
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:10,282
In fact, we're the ones
holding something over your head.

364
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,703
All I have to do

365
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,872
is vote for you guys
in the next game?

366
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,123
Ra Hae-jun is in.

367
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,876
The next target is
Song Jae-hyeong.

368
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,963
Great photo.

369
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:27,382
Look at these muscles.

370
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,885
I love it.

371
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,678
Was it fun leaving us behind?

372
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,513
-What?
-Bitch, let's just go.

373
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,723
Forget it.

374
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,516
We're not waiting.
Come on.

375
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,893
See you.

376
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,227
What's up with her?

377
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,896
Damn it, she's too
good for us now?

378
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,528
Hey.
What are they doing here?

379
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,946
It's them, right?

380
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,241
Your "friends" you used
to get into trouble with.

381
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,659
They were just in
the neighborhood.

382
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,911
Yeah right.

383
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,246
I heard them bothering you.

384
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,291
If you start
hanging out with them again,

385
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,920
I'm gonna kill you.

386
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,636
I'm not stupid.

387
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,181
What matters to me the most
right now is swimming and...

388
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,895
Me?

389
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,317
You're a good friend,
aren't you, Eun-jeong?

390
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,489
By the way,

391
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,075
have you seen this?

392
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,537
She implies that
she actually knows you.

393
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,915
You think she's one
of those obsessive fans?

394
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,959
Trainees don't have
obsessive fans.

395
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,460
Let's go.

396
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,796
Come on.

397
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,425
You need to stop this.

398
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,972
Please, Wu-ri.

399
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,433
What do you want me to do?

400
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,851
Get out!

401
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,145
Get out!

402
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,148
Get out!

403
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,405
What do you want me to do?

404
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,240
Tell me, what can I do?

405
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,075
Get out!

406
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,686
Ji-ae, hang in there.

407
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,856
It's all going to be okay soon.

408
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,115
Slowly, carefully.

409
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,410
-Thank you.
-Sure.

410
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,203
-Bye.
-Thanks for coming.

411
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,123
YE-RIM, WHAT ARE
YOU LOOKING AT? LOL

412
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:07,000
Forget it.
Just ignore it.

413
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,921
Oh?

414
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:13,590
That guy...

415
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,052
Are you okay?

416
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,678
What about?

417
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,805
Oh, Ji-ae?

418
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,141
I'll soothe things over.

419
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,643
Things will go according to plan.
Don't worry about it.

420
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,229
No, not Ji-ae.

421
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,942
-You looked hurt.
-Me?

422
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:38,907
I'm fine. I just lost it for a
sec because of her attitude.

423
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,410
If you say so.

424
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,414
Ji-ae is like
an whiny, immature little kid,

425
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,333
but she's not a bad person.

426
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,586
Humans usually act according
to the situation they're in.

427
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,130
She was just a bystander.

428
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,590
Like I was.

429
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,258
But not you.

430
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,596
The real game starts now

431
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,099
but what are we going to do
about Jae-hyeong and Yu-rim?

432
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,268
You don't happen to have
anything on Yu-rim...

433
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,022
Never mind.

434
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,488
Your wrist.

435
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,741
Did you really mean it?

436
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,327
You wanted to die?

437
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,832
I don't know.

438
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,627
It was that terrible for you,

439
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,921
but you still wanted
to help Ji-ae?

440
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:39,384
And you eventually agreed to
get Yu-rim involved in our plan.

441
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:48,476
Oh, I just remembered.

442
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,146
I was wondering where
I saw him before.

443
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,497
-Ja-eun, can you hear me?
-Yes.

444
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,083
-You're recording this, right?
-Yes.

445
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,669
Call the police right away
if anything happens.

446
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,422
You're Cho Wu-ri's brother,
aren't you?

447
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,371
What were you doing in here?

448
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,666
Seong Su-ji! Seong Su-ji!

449
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,552
Yes, I found it.

450
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:06,596
I left it in the restroom
of the new building.

451
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,681
Yes, goodbye.

452
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,021
Wait.

453
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,648
You're a hacker?

454
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,233
I read an article about
the "Data Monster."

455
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,401
KOREAN HACKER
"DATA MONSTER" RANKS 3RD

456
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,903
IN INTERNATIONAL HACKING CONTEST

457
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,071
Why did you come here?

458
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,572
To get something?
To steal something?

459
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,282
Did Wu-ri make you do this?

460
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,077
The Pyramid Game.

461
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,789
The one you play in class.
What is it exactly?

462
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,585
Su-ji!

463
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:49,597
That part-timer
at the convenience store.

464
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,392
I mean, Cho Wu-ri's brother.
Let's get him to help us.

465
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,436
What?
No way.

466
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,605
Getting Hae-jun to work with
us is nowhere near enough.

467
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,774
We don't even have any info
on Jae-hyeong or Yu-rim.

468
00:30:59,857 --> 00:31:01,276
And we're running out of time
until the next game.

469
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,069
Still, it's too dangerous.

470
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,488
We don't know anything
about him.

471
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,031
I know him a bit.

472
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:09,450
Besides, you're supposed
to team up with people

473
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,785
who are in similar situations.

474
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,370
Not people like our
literature teacher.

475
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,372
People like you, me, Ji-ae
and that guy.

476
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:23,381
Remember how I said
Ye-won could help us get dirt?

477
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,134
Wu-ri's brother
could do it instead.

478
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:28,636
What do you know about Wu-ri?
Tell me everything.

479
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:37,812
CHO SEUNG-HWA

480
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,772
It's bullying, right?

481
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,984
That vote and those
rankings or whatever.

482
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,902
If you don't get any votes, you
become the target of bullying?

483
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,988
How is Wu-ri doing?

484
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,619
She hasn't left her

The only thing I can tell you
is that Wu-ri is a victim.

487
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,211
You want to know

488
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:04,631
what happened to
your little sister, right?

489
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,550
How about we work together?

A perv?

What a great photo.

498
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,574
Look at his body. Oh my god.

You can choose the sauce.

00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:36,180
Mm, this is good.

503
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,766
-Wanna split it?
-Sure.

504
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,771
This is good too.

505
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,190
Oh, right. Look.

506
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,278
What's this?

507
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,029
They're from Jae-hyeong's
photo album.

508
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,449
Photos she secretly took
of people who are buff and tough.

509
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,951
If anyone finds out, she's
done for. Let's use this.

510
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,582
Eat. Lunch time is almost over.

511
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:04,292
Huh? Oh.

512
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:07,295
Song Jae-hyeong.

513
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:11,048
-I'll talk to her.
-You think you can do it?

514
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,426
Yes, I'll try.

515
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,054
I feel bad about leaving
everything to you.

516
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:21,809
There was nothing particular
on Cho Yu-rim.

517
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,519
There is one thing.

518
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,146
Look.

519
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,482
It's the same exact
painting that Yu-rim won

520
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:28,608
an award for at school.

521
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,569
CHO YU-RIM

522
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,621
Woah, that was close.

523
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,039
Hey, Ha-rin.

524
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,415
Thanks.

525
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,334
I got the text yesterday.

526
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,336
Oh...

527
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,050
Any changes
regarding Cho Yu-rim?

528
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,807
ANY CHANGES
REGARDING CHO YU-RIM?

530
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,403
Looking good today.

531
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,574
Wow, all that sweat.

532
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,368
What do you want?

533
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:24,330
You're a fan
of Shownu X Hyungwon, right?

534
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,834
You want this?

535
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,169
No thanks.

536
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,423
According to experts,

537
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:38,386
Shownu and Hyungwon
both have great physique,

538
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:43,891
and have well developed biceps.

539
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,393
Uh...

540
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,438
Muscles are built up
through weight training.

541
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,567
There's something called BCAA.

542
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,069
Leucine, valine, isoleucine...

543
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:56,362
Ah...

544
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,451
-Did you see?
-No.

545
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,744
You saw.

546
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,246
No.

547
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,709
Wouldn't it be better to ask

548
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:11,878
if it's okay to take
their photos first?

549
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,838
Portrait rights and all...

550
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:15,256
Hmph.

551
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,926
Mm, nice.

552
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,223
Why are you following me around?

553
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,977
If you're alone...

554
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,230
You might like a perv.

555
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,607
Wow.

556
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,528
She's not around this time?

557
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,448
Well, better for me.

558
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,243
Let's get some good shots.

559
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,544
What are you doing?

560
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,922
Were you taking photos of us?

561
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,674
No, I was taking a selfie.

562
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,644
I'll have her delete them.
I'm sorry.

563
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:15,900
She probably didn't mean
to take them.

564
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,155
Sorry, I overslept.

565
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:24,659
You...

566
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,662
You...

567
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,126
I told you to come out.

568
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,212
Stop talking.

569
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:44,136
You're a F.
The lowest of the low.

570
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,805
Know your place.

571
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,851

00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,003
Ji-ae, are you okay?

576
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,153
Yu-rim was selected
for a scholarship

577
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,487
by Baekyeon Art yesterday.

578
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,947
Ha-rin must be behind it.

579
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,867
Ha-rin?

580
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,829
I wonder how much
she knows about our plan...

581
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,918
Ji-ae, about what I said
the other day...

582
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:00,963
Oh.
You were right.

583
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,423
I was wrong.

584
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,801
I guess this means
we have to recruit

585
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,386
Seung-ie instead of Yu-rim?

586
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:10,931
-To the alliance of the Ds.
-Will you be okay with it?

587
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,809
It doesn't matter.

588
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,271
This easily?

589
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,529
The smell of cigarettes.

590
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,823
What?

591
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,619
Nothing.
How's it going with Jae-hyeong?

592
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,538
I've gotten a lot closer but...

593
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,749
Don't tell me
you haven't used that photo.

594
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:39,001
It's the easier and surest way.

595
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,254
I'm not as good as you at that.

596
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:47,426
-I'm doing it my own way for now.
-Your way?

597
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,821
The Ds...

598
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,100
-This is Baek Ha-rin?
-Yeah.

599
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,895
She just looks like a normal
higher school girl.

600
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,149
I've done some searching

601
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,317
but there are no photos
of her online.

602
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,194
The company must keep things
under tight control.

603
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,863
There's hardly
any info on her either.

604
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,573
Just a rumor that her
grandmother the Chairman is

605
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,449
wrapped around her finger.

606
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,874
Who should I look into next?

607
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,792
Joo Seung-ie.
This girl here.

608
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,008
DAD

609
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,135
Hello?

610
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,220
I won't be able to
make it home today.

611
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,222
-Did you eat?
-I ate and cleaned up.

612
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,308
I'll lock the doors and check
the gas before going to bed.

613
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,351
I heard that it's Parents' Day
at your school tomorrow.

614
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,103
Oh, you don't have to come.

615
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,771
It's not mandatory.

616
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:23,898
Okay then.

617
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,566
Good night.

618
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,070
SEONG SU-JI, DAUGHTER

619
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:40,539
Found something on Seung-ie.

620
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:45,085
VOTE D-2

621
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,174
Seung-ie, are you asleep?

622
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:55,930
No, but what's
with the sudden text?

623
00:41:56,889 --> 00:42:00,684
You don't want anyone to find
out about your secret, do you?

624
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,273
WELCOME, PARENTS' DAY

625
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:10,903
15TH PYRAMID GAME D-1

626
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,550
Attention, everyone.

627
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:37,304
Moms, dads, if you all wait
in the waiting room,

628
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,723
you'll be able to listen in
on the 5th period class.

629
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,945
I talked Jae-hyeong into it.

630
00:42:53,028 --> 00:42:54,863
She wants to talk
to you guys herself.

631
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:05,624
Hi, guys.

632
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,920
So, this is where you hang out?

633
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,505
It's nice.

634
00:43:11,588 --> 00:43:13,674
It's got a youthful vibe.

635
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,884
You don't mind if I come up
here sometimes, do you?

636
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,511
Has she always been so bubbly?

637
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,472
-So, you'll cooperate with us?
-Yes!

638
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:23,058
I like Ja-eun.

639
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:26,812
Turns out there was real power
behind this frail looking body.

640
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,063
Not because of the photo?

641
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,190
Photo? What photo?

642
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,654
I don't know what that is,

643
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:40,075
but can I give you a word of
advice now that we're a team?

644
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,827
Don't think this'll be easy.

645
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,788
Especially Ha-rin.

646
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,208
Yu-rim betrayed
you last year, right?

647
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,503
How did you...

648
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,923
Do you know why?

649
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,717
I do.

650
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,677
I just happened to see

651
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,055
how Ha-rin got to her last year.

652
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,725
Ha-rin knows exactly

653
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,560
how to manipulate everyone.

654
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:08,270
She's the queen bitch.

655
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,409
Ra Hae-jun, Song Jae-hyeong,
Joo Seung-ie, and us three.

656
00:44:22,534 --> 00:44:24,953
The Ds now have an alliance.

657
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,916
There's also one
addition to the plan.

658
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:35,714
2-5 PARENTS' WAITING ROOM

659
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,727
I didn't see him last year.

660
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:51,939
Oh...

661
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,400
Oh, Do-ah's mom.

662
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,027
Hello, how have you been?

663
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:06,620
Are you Seong Su-ji's father?

664
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,455
Yes, I am.

665
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,835
I'm sorry to ask,
but how much do you know

666
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,129
about your
daughter's school life?

667
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:32,813
By any chance, do you like me?

668
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:35,023
-What?
-You voted for me.

669
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,942
And kept trying to help me.

670
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,488
You're really something.

671
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,739
You're hilarious.

672
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,825
Or do you just loathe her?

673
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,035
Baek Ha-rin.

674
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:49,496
You told me before

675
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,373
that you play this game

676
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,292
to keep your secret.

677
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,794
I know now.

678
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:59,006
The secret, your weakness
that Ha-rin is holding over you.

679
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,924
There can only be one thing.

680
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,509
It's Sim Eun-jeong, isn't it?

681
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,688
So, are you trying
to blackmail me?

682
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:17,191
I just told you
I know what Ha-rin knows.

683
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,609
What do you think I'll do?

684
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:22,237
You're like her.

685
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,782
-What do you want?
-That was quick.

686
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,036
I want you to become the F
in the next game.

687
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,120
What?

688
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,080
Born rich and a trainee
at a major entertainment agency.

689
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,292
You're pretty and get top grades.
If you become the F,

690
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,878
will the kids be
able to bully you?

691
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,672
-No.
-It'll disrupt the order.

692
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,884
Don't you want
to screw Ha-rin over?

693
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:51,391
I believe she's independent,
and conducts herself well.

694
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:54,478
You have no idea
what's happening at school,

695
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:56,855
but you simply believe

696
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,066
that everything is okay
with your child?

697
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:04,196
There is bullying
going on in class 2-5.

698
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:16,875
Why do you think
I'll go along with this?

699
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,836
Because you were the only girl
who opposed to this game.

700
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,171
Right?

701
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,507
This is my plan.

702
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,426
The pyramid?

703
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,844
Fuck it.

704
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:31,765
PYRAMID GAME
