1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:03,086
Ja-eun, you answer.

2
00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,587
Do you want to stay as an F?

3
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:06,756
No.

4
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,051
I don't.

5
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:15,050
subtitles for the platform @mkdoramas

6
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:20,186
You heard her.

7
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,604
Now beat it.

8
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,691
You rich, pretty,

9
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,068
and manipulative bully.

10
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,657
A bully?

11
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,497
If I'm a bully,
I wonder what you are, Ja-eun.

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:43,418
I've been thinking
why do you suddenly have hope?

13
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,798
It's okay though.

14
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,633
I'll snuff it out of you soon.

15
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,109
It was Ha-rin, right? She's the
one who dropped our rank.

16
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,653
What about Wu-ie then?
Is she out?

17
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:12,989
I don't know.

18
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,492
Hell, are you okay with this?

19
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,660
If Ha-rin turns on us...

20
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,829
If my dad finds out...

21
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,916
Shit.

22
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,857
Ye-rim.

23
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:51,069
I'm sorry!

24
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,032
Are you in love with me?

25
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,702
For real?

26
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,330
I thought it was just a joke
common in girls' high schools.

27
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,834
Listen carefully, Eun-jeong.

28
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,129
If my debut falls through
because of your stupid crush...

29
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,881
That's not going to happen!

30
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,176
You'll get to debut.

EPISODE 6

36
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,054
We need to get more
people on our side.

37
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,514
Not with threats like last time,

38
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,391
but like how you
persuaded Jae-hyeong.

39
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,852
We can't be like Ha-rin.
We have to be more like you.

40
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,271
Like Ja-eun...

41
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,524
What would you do?

42
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,025
What?

43
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,201
Seung-ie.

44
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,869
About what happened...

45
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:48,871
Huh?

46
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:52,208
If you really felt hurt
because of me,

47
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,336
I'm sorry.

48
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,879
I mean it.

49
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,798
Oh?

50
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,014
Okay...

51
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,726
-Thanks for accepting my apology.
-I'm really sorry again.

52
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,234
You did good.

53
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,242
Hi, Ji-ae.

54
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,832
-What?
-You're friends with Ji-ae?

55
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,334
No, I just said hi.

56
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,918
I'm allowed to say hi, aren't I?

57
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,420
Fs

58
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,881
don't exist anymore.

59
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,302
On that note,

60
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,555
I'm thinking about doing away
with the game altogether.

61
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,849
What do you think, Ha-rin?

62
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,184
You always win by
a landslide anyway.

63
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,643
21 votes.

64
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,605
At the very top,
even among the As.

65
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,940
The person who'll be the sorriest
to see the Pyramid Game go

66
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,609
would be you.

67
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,444
Oh, that's right.

68
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,614
You said you were just one
of the 25 girls in this class.

69
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,116
Then if everyone agrees,
I guess it won't matter.

70
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:08,493
Right?

71
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,620
-Are you nuts?
-Seong Su-ji, you bitch!

72
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,331
Give a little warning before
you go off like that, Wu-ie.

73
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,293
What if you scare Ha-rin again?

74
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,049
Let me know if you agree

75
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,551
either by social media or text.

76
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,053
Anytime.

77
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,931
Oh, Ha-rin. You too.

78
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,893
She crushed it! Woo!

79
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,064
Ja-eun, hi!

80
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,336
I'm sorry.

81
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,838
I mean it.

82
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:02,839
Huh?

83
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,090
Hi, Ji-ae.

84
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,842
Ja-eun, hi!

85
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,637
I'm thinking about doing away
with the game altogether.

86
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,557
You said you were just one
of the 25 girls in this class.

87
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,105
You want the data
on who voted for whom?

88
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,398
Why?

89
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,858
Just because.

90
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,498
Da-yeon, let's go get
some snacks. On me.

91
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:42,503
Do-ah, you wanna go?

92
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,677
What are you staring at?

93
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,180
Do-ah, Da-yeon, Wu-ie.

94
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,640
Their long-term rule is over.

95
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,643
Seol-ha may have looked like
she was part of the group,

96
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,604
but she was never on
Ha-rin's good side.

97
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,400
But how on earth
did Eun-byeol become an A?

98
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,473
Do-ah, Da-yeon,

99
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,392
if you're going to get snacks,
bring me some chocolate milk.

100
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,270
I get low on sugar after calculus.

101
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,065
-What?
-Didn't you hear me?

102
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,524
Chocolate milk.

103
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,817
Get me some.

104
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:49,904
Oh, Ha-rin is here.

105
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,782
Ye-rim, Ha-rin,
you guys want anything?

106
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,117
We can ask them to get it for us.

107
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:03,584
Is that really Eun-byeol?

108
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,419
Maybe she had an evil twin?

109
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,589
She came to school
with an entirely different soul.

110
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,468
Her grades may been 2nd in our
year, but she was a total loser!

111
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,220
Eun-byeol

112
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:16,973
must've been Ha-rin's hidden card
from the start.

113
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,146
Ha-rin, I was waiting for you.

114
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,362
Anything you want me
to do today?

115
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:35,866
I need to talk to you.

116
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,368
Good.

117
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,578
Here, your reward.

118
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,749
Thanks.

119
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,463
JUNIOR YEAR PHYSICS

120
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,632
MIDTERM FOR SECOND SEMESTER

121
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,760
Come to the Director's office
at lunchtime tomorrow.

122
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,803
Eun-byeol.

123
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,847
Do you feel a little better?

124
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,183
Do-ah and Da-yeon...

125
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,561
Your sidekicks dropped to a B.

126
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,272
Do-ah deserved it

127
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,443
but Ye-rim replacing Da-yeon
wasn't the plan.

128
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,615
That means the morons
in our class voted for her.

129
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,116
This is so annoying!

130
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,203
Still, you don't have to worry.

131
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,707
I'll do whatever you want me to.

132
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,378
Just help me out
during the finals too.

133
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,394
So, these are
the final members?

134
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,688
Ye-rim instead of Ji-ae?

135
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,858
A loser is out, and a star is in.

136
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:53,819
Oops.

137
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,154
Don't say that.

138
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,406
I was just kidding.

139
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,909
This is Ye-rim.

140
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,744
She's popular in the class
and an idol trainee.

141
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,746
She has as much influence
as Ha-rin over the girls.

142
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,422
Wait, you're Wu-ri's brother?

143
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,715
Sorry, Ye-rim.

144
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,759
He already got that
reaction from us.

145
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,636
Really?

146
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,430
How is Wu-ri?

147
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,432
She turned into a hikikomori.

148
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,394
Were you a part of it?

149
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,606
Yes, I was a bystander.

150
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:37,279
I don't want to be this time.

151
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,283
So, Su-ji?

152
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,452
Did anyone reach out?

153
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,371
Of course

154
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,164
not.

155
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,792
They have no reason
to bet on us. Yet.

156
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,294
Then, what's our next plan?

157
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,256
We have to turn the princess
into a commoner.

158
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,092
First thing to do,
bring Ha-rin down.

159
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,718
CLEANING IS EVERYONE'S JOB

160
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,930
Ha-rin!

161
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:03,848
Where are you going?

162
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,349
You're in charge of
cleaning the classroom.

163
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,394
Eun-byeol, the room
on the 2nd floor.

164
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,188
What?
Ha-rin never cleans.

165
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,773
Huh? Why not?

166
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,151
We're all equals here, aren't we?

167
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,318
Su-ji,

168
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,820
we're As.

169
00:12:18,737 --> 00:12:20,072
Oh...

170
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,782
Ye-rim, you have to help.

171
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,660
So?

172
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,078
Ye-rim is an A too.

173
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,663
But she's cleaning.

174
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,623
Sure I am.

175
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,709
Eun-byeol, does this annoy you?

176
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,171
Ugh, I can't do this.

177
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,007
It's not even trendy anymore.

178
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,017
That's enough.

179
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,226
You think you've
become something

180
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,352
because Ye-rim
is taking your side?

181
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,521
Damn it.

182
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,358
What did you just say to me?

183
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,861
Watch it. You're in no position
to be violent.

184
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,238
Also, what's the big deal
about cleaning?

185
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,617
Ha-rin, you didn't
start this, did you?

186
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,328
Is holding a broom too
lowly a job for an A?

187
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,704
You're going to skip cleaning?

188
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,499
Wow, that would
really suck, right?

189
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,125
Yeah, a lot.

190
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,714
You can get more brooms
from the teacher's office.

191
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,216
Thanks.

192
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,482
You can't?

193
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:42,404
Did you think
I was asking for a favor?

194
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:45,950
Thanks for this.

195
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,284
But I'm a techie,

196
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,370
not someone who uses tech
to do someone else's bidding.

197
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,622
That would be an insult
to the app I created.

198
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:54,917
Also, I got a D
again in this game

199
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,585
with only one vote.

200
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:05,719
You think I care?

201
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,721
You're all so stupid.

202
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,020
What the...

203
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:18,107
She's insane. Does she
know how much this costs?

204
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:20,150
Seriously!

205
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,116
BAEK HA-RIN HAS SENT $4,840 SENDER
MAY CANCEL BEFORE YOU ACCEPT

206
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,952
What a bitch.

207
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,836
It's Jae-hyeong.

208
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,630
Hey, what happened to you?

209
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,299
Did Ha-rin do this to you?

210
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,843
No, there was a leak
under the sink...

211
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,261
Huh?

212
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,972
My sink broke down

213
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,433
and I was trying to fix it.

214
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,810
Oh...

215
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,329
You're really coming over?

216
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,788
Why? You don't want me to?

217
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,917
It's not that.
It's just a really old house.

218
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,046
Let's go.

219
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,808
Aren't we going in?

220
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,560
You said your sink needs fixing.

221
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,020
Yeah.

222
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,620
There.

223
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,914
Here.

224
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,415
Clean your hands.

225
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,542
Okay.

226
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,420
Thanks. Tomorrow, I'll...

227
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,547
I'll buy you ma-malatang.

228
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:06,882
Do you have any ramyeon at home?

229
00:16:06,965 --> 00:16:08,300
Ramyeon?

230
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,552
You want to eat
here before you go?

231
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,762
Yes.

232
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,222
Oh...

233
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,192
That hurts.

234
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,819
Jae-hyeong says

235
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:29,363
this ramyeon is
super popular these days.

236
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,117
If you don't like it,

237
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,620
I got cheese ramyeon,

238
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,914
or fish cake ramyeon,

239
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,124
or tteok ramyeon.

240
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,251
If you like dumpling ramyeon,
I got dumplings

241
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,752
so you can make that if you want.

242
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,463
What is all this?
Why'd you buy so much?

243
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,801
I didn't know what you liked...

244
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,808
You want some rabokki?

245
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,894
Dig in.

246
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,278
You can cook too?

247
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,696
Just a few things.

248
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,490
The gate creaking...

249
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,117
Get some lubricant spray.

250
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,286
-Lubricant...
-Spray.

251
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,954
Oh, okay.

252
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:22,207
How do you know so much?

253
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:23,959
You even fixed the sink.

254
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,295
I just look things up on YouTube
to solve things on my own.

255
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,796
Since I don't have a mom.

256
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,175
Sorry.

257
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,469
Is that your mom in the photo?

258
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,930
You said she didn't live here?

259
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,390
Yeah.

260
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,936
She moved to Busan
after my dad died last year.

261
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,856
I'm going to
live there too one day.

262
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,317
I want to farm
and help out with the orchard.

263
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,154
She wants me to become
a civil servant though.

264
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:54,907
What do you want to be?

265
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,325
A building owner.

266
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:59,912
Job-wise... I want to be
a documentary producer.

267
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,588
I think you'll be good at anything

268
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,881
since you get good grades.

269
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,508
Sorry.

270
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,136
Is it Jae-hyeong again?

271
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,431
HA-RIN
NEW MESSAGE

272
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,944
HA-RIN
COME OUT. NOW

273
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,029
How long

274
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,906
have you known Ha-rin?

275
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,284
Seems like you go way back.

276
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,537
In elementary school...

277
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:49,837
We were in the same class
until she transferred out.

278
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,135
Dig in.

279
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:06,061
Have you
heard of Madagascar?

280
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,564
My mom is on a
business trip there.

281
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,482
She goes to Italy,
and the U.S. too.

282
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,735
My dad works at
a big company in Seoul.

283
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,696
You know Baekyeon Group, right?

284
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,657
It's the biggest company
in the country.

285
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:23,078
Anyway, I used up all my
allowance to buy a Nintendo.

286
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,872
I'll buy next time, Ja-eun.

287
00:19:26,164 --> 00:19:27,457
Thanks.

288
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,964
I'm sorry
but I'm not an F anymore.

289
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,925
MYEONG JA-EUN

290
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,940
No one has reached out yet?

291
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,775
Not yet.

292
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,778
For the next part of the plan,
we need to spread a rumor.

293
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,280
A rumor?

294
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:00,407
Wait,

295
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,784
-where's Ja-eun?
-We have to start without her

296
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,995
because this rumor is about her.

297
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,997
Jae-hyeong, this is your
area of expertise, right?

298
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:09,207
Nope!
Just one of many.

299
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,127
This isn't a betrayal, is it?

300
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,881
You heard about Ja-eun?

301
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,467
I feel kind of bad.

302
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:22,054
I thought she became an F because
she was so gloomy and creepy.

303
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,722
But turns out she was betrayed.

304
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,808
-Really?
-Yeah.

305
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,145
Yeon-du sprayed it all over me.

306
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:37,819
Ja-eun! Over here.

307
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:41,281
Ye-rim, what are you doing?

308
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,825
You've never talked to Ja-eun
before, have you?

309
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,161
We're all in the same class.
It'd be nice to be friends.

310
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,836
Ha-rin, your goal is to
make Ja-eun the F permanently,

311
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,172
but mine is the exact opposite.

312
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,758
We'll be summarizing

313
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,010
the composers and their works
in the Romantic Era.

314
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,055
One of the main composers
was Schubert.

315
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,556
Hey.

316
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:12,270
Doesn't Ja-eun seem more
ordinary than you think?

317
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,106
She's pretty nice.

318
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,858
Who the hell betrayed her?

319
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,360
I know.

320
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,570
It's one of us.

321
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:23,865
If it were me,
I'd want to die about now.

322
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,122
Seong-ah,
I'm on duty today.

323
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,665
Can you take this
to the teacher's office for me?

324
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,125
Me?

325
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,544
-Why?
-You only got one vote.

326
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,796
I'll take it. I'm really strong.

327
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,424
Huh?
But you got more than one vote.

328
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,218
We're all friends here.

329
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,471
Wow, so nice.

330
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,056
Why was she ever an F?

331
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,100
Come to think of it,
ever since she started voting,

332
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,060
Ja-eun has never been the F.

333
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,896
She just rejected playing the game
because she didn't like it?

334
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,690
That's so cool.

335
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:59,901
See how she helped
Seong-ah just now.

336
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,319
Ja-eun is so cool.

337
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,004
GREAT JOB, GUYS
THE SECOND STAGE IS GOING TO PLAN

338
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,299
For the third stage,
we have to change the rules.

339
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,260
I'll tell you on Monday...

340
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,474
-Hi, Dad.
-Going out?

341
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,933
To the convenience store.

342
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,351
I'll be right back.

343
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,103
I've been reassigned again.

344
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,397
I have to start work in Paju
starting next month.

345
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,107
Get ready to transfer schools.

346
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:40,984
What?

347
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,197
30 people were trapped

348
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,698
in a warehouse fire
in Gyeonggi-do...

349
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,701
There has been no
contact for 7 hours.

350
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:50,702
The building...

351
00:22:50,786 --> 00:22:52,454
Out of those 30 people...

352
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,625
If you were the only one
who could be rescued,

353
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,128
what would you do?

354
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,466
People instinctively
want to survive, don't they?

355
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,260
I'd live,
and live with the guilt.

356
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,313
What?

357
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,272
No way.

358
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,690
They're all different.
I like this one.

359
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,488
Things can go back
to the way it was.

360
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,699
I can get out of here.

361
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,700
See you.

362
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,868
Alone.

363
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,915
Tell the school
about your transfer this week.

364
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,003
THE GIRLS

365
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,424
Should we go ahead
with Stage 3 today?

366
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,221
TELL THE SCHOOL
ABOUT YOUR TRANSFER THIS WEEK

367
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,681
Yes.

368
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,353
Ye-rim, why don't you
take point on this one?

369
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,024
I'll support from behind.

370
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,201
I was thinking...

371
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,371
If we don't get an F
in the next game either,

372
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,373
why don't we get rid of
the As' benefits too?

373
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:22,961
If there's no lower rank
to mess around with,

374
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,671
there's no point in being As.

375
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,549
Also, Da-yeon, Wu-i, and Seol-ha,

376
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,509
you should apologize to Ja-eun.

377
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:31,011
I heard you broke the rules.

378
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,139
"Leave no trace no matter what."

379
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,099
Did you forget?

380
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,102
What?

381
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,396
-I didn't do anything.
-Don't deny it.

382
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,231
There was a witness.

383
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,566
I saw everything.

384
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,735
On August 31st,
after 4th period PE.

385
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,069
In the gym closet.

386
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,654
You guys beat her up until
she was black and blue.

387
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:09,132
We didn't.

388
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,092
Then, can the three of you
say where you were

389
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,345
and what you were doing on
that day at the same time?

390
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,773
Ye-rim.

391
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,444
There will be an F
in the next game.

392
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,789
Based on what?

393
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,207
We didn't have one this time.

394
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,085
So, you're against it, right?

395
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,630
Then, should we vote on it?

396
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,715
Okay.

397
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,967
Let's do that.

398
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,469
If we don't get an
F in the next game,

399
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,389
the As will lose
their benefits too.

400
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,648
Even if I'm not around,

401
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,109
things have started to change.

402
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,487
It won't be like before.

403
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,287
Are you not feeling well?
You look like you've lost weight.

404
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,788
MOM

405
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,165
Is it just the screen?

406
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,545
What about dinner?
What did you eat?

407
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,005
I'm not sick.

408
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,756
I had some ramyeon
with friends earlier.

409
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,758
Ramyeon?
You should eat a proper meal!

410
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,759
What about you?

411
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,177
I ate too.

412
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,846
Ramyeon.

413
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,141
By the way, Ja-eun.

414
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:44,936
So-eun came by yesterday.

415
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,871
-Kim Da-yeon.
-Here.

416
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,372
-Cho Mi-yeong.
-Here.

417
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,749
-Ra Hae-jun.
-Here.

418
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,544
Myeong Ja-eun.
She's absent again?

419
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,048
For two days in a row
without any notice?

420
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,009
Mr. Im, Ha-rin isn't here either.

421
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,178
She requested
a field trip today.

422
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:22,724
That'll be all.

423
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:27,062
First period is music.

424
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,524
Please leave a message
after the beep.

425
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,735
MYEONG JA-EUN

426
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,236
Still not answering?

427
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,240
She hasn't been
taking my calls since yesterday.

428
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,742
I'm getting a bad feeling.

429
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,795
I'll talk to the school
about my transfer in a few days.

430
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,215
MYEONG JA-EUN

431
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:58,426
I was wondering why you
took me to the department store.

432
00:27:58,593 --> 00:28:00,011
Be honest with me.

433
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,472
Where did you get
all those gift certificates?

434
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:03,765
We'll talk inside.

435
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,184
I'm so happy.

436
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:09,270
I live downstairs, Lieutenant
Colonel Seong Hee-seok...

437
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:12,440
Oh, you brought us
the plant last time.

438
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,650
Are you coming back
from after-school classes?

439
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,361
Yes, do you need any help?
You have a lot to carry.

440
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,363
Oh, you really don't have to,

441
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,282
but thank you.

442
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,784
HONG SANG-GU

443
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,632
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SEONG HEE-SEOK
TRANSFERRED TO INFANTRY UNIT 0663

444
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,426
COLONEL HONG SANG-GU

445
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,302
HONG SANG-GU

446
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,723
There will be an F
in the next game.

447
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,310
But why am I the only one
rescued of all people?

448
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,395
You want to turn a blind eye?

449
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,647
You think it's a coincidence?

450
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,482
Transfer? All of a sudden?

451
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,483
I know it's sudden.

452
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,860
I wasn't expecting this either.

453
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:58,153
I thought you'd be
able to graduate

454
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,529
from your current school.

455
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,203
BAEK HA-RIN

456
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,378
This is Su-ji.

457
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,174
Su-ji?

458
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:22,844
I don't know what this is about,
but I'm a little busy right now.

459
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,933
SEONG SU-JI

460
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,603
SEONG SU-JI

461
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,525
SOS.

462
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,111
Did you want to call out for help?

463
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,571
Oh well.

464
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,364
It's just the two of us here.

465
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:06,804
It was a popular song back then.
Do you remember?

466
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,058
You always forget everything
so easily.

467
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,561
I haven't forgotten a thing.

468
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,775
Does your mom know?

469
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:23,613
Why I'm
tormenting you so much.

470
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,865
You can tell her.

471
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,327
What I did was wrong.

472
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,246
Can I tell your new friends too?

473
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,915
What I did was wrong.

474
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,610
You know about this place?

475
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,243
It's no coincidence.

476
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,328
-Isn't that right?
-What?

477
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,122
Don't play dumb.

478
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,999
You used your rich
parents' connections

479
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,750
so that I wouldn't
get in your way anymore.

480
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,128
I'm telling you now, I'm not
transferring to a new school.

481
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,756
You can't get rid of me.

482
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,216
A new school?

483
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,885
I thought you'd be happy.

484
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,304
I would've been.

485
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,347
Because

486
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,308
Su-ji, the Pyramid Game

487
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:36,561
will never end.

488
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,813
It can't, because of Ja-eun.

489
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,442
Can you anticipate
how far I'll go?

490
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,486
I can't.

491
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:48,865
Run. Now's your chance.

492
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,705
You're a psycho.

493
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,665
You're really going
to destroy the game?

494
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:58,875
No.

495
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,335
I'm going to

496
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,504
destroy you too
for the game to be truly over.

497
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:06,966
You are the Pyramid Game.

498
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,891
But...

499
00:32:15,933 --> 00:32:18,144
Why are you trembling
so much, Su-ji?

500
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,355
Were you waiting for me?

501
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,815
Since when?

502
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,775
Why didn't you call?

503
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:09,487
I dropped my phone a few
days ago and it broke.

504
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,906
I didn't wait that long.

505
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,076
Why did you miss out on school?

506
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,829
I had a cold.

507
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,999
I had something to tell
you and the others

508
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,461
once we got rid of the game.

509
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:27,380
Will you be here

510
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,091
until then?

511
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:35,596
Dad, I'm not changing schools.

512
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,640
I'm going to graduate from here.

513
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,350
If that's what want,

514
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,519
then alright. You do that.

515
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,022
Let's go.

516
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,649
Mr. Im is going to
give you an earful

517
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,151
for missing school
without any notice.

518
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,947
I know.
I shouldn't have.

519
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:58,619
Before we go, let's drop
by the convenience store.

520
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,497
Hello.

521
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,667
Do you have the recordings?

522
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,503
We have quite a lot now.

523
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,172
Evidence we collected.

524
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,465
How are you going to release it?

525
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:11,883
With a YouTube account

526
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:13,968
from another country.
It can't be traced that way.

527
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:18,765
I'm going to break it
wide open soon.

528
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,353
Class 2-5's
Pyramid Game...

529
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,063
-You bitch.
-I'll crush you.

530
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:26,981
Have you been curious?

531
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:27,940
You psycho!

532
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,067
You bitch!

533
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,651
-You were an F...
-Shit.

534
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,571
There will be
an F in the next game.

535
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,158
I made a short, shocking version.

536
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:40,161
It'll get more hits
based on the algorithm.

537
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,622
But...

538
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,208
once this gets released

539
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,835
you could end up like my sister.

540
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,214
I'm exposing this
so that it won't happen.

541
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,800
Politicians' children, national
team athletes, celebrities...

542
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,511
Do you know what
they're most afraid of?

543
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,096
Tip-offs.

544
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,847
Tip-offs from the public.

545
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,766
How lucky are we

546
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,018
that Baek Ha-rin is from
a major conglomerate family.

547
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,361
Hey, it's Ja-eun.

548
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,779
She came to school today.

549
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,572
-Hi, Ja-eun.
-Hi.

550
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,592
Ha-rin, we're friends.

551
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,220
If you don't like something
about me, I'll change.

552
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,137
I'll change everything.

553
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,556
I won't bother you either.

554
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,057
Really. I promise.

555
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:45,852
Tell her.

556
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,062
What I did was wrong.

557
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,319
Ja-eun too!

558
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,405
I'll mess her up good.

559
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,823
I'll totally kill her.

560
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:01,993
Friends?

561
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,623
Wu-ie.

562
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,669
I don't treat my friends
this way.

563
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,109
Stop being funny

564
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,569
and get out.

565
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,906
Hey, Do-ah.

566
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,073
You too.

567
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:44,076
Ha-rin and I have a lot to
talk about with Da-yeon.

568
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,668
Wow, it's so soft.

569
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,587
How much does something
like this cost?

570
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,339
It must be expensive.

571
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,134
By the way,
did you like the photo?

572
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:02,428
I was wondering if
I got a good shot.

573
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,430
Yes.

574
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,767
-I like it.
-I'm glad.

575
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,144
Also, I think we need
to tighten control

576
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,605
on the morons in our class.

577
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,107
No matter how much
they get their hopes up,

578
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,817
the game will never stop, ever.

579
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,738
Should we go with that concept?

580
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,657
Sure.

581
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,992
Let's do it during PE.

582
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,619
I'll arrange it.

583
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:31,958
What is she, five?
This is so stupid.

584
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,179
What are you doing here?

585
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:48,349
Our phones must've
gotten switched earlier.

586
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:50,851
Do-ah.

587
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,687
The ballet studio at lunch.

588
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:53,980
Ballet studio?

589
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,398
Baek Ha-rin's group?

590
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,030
Oh...

591
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,709
Do-ah, you're back
to being cute again.

592
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,711
There's nothing useful.

593
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,421
It's okay.

594
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,880
We have enough.

595
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,390
-Dinner?
-Yes.

596
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,726
My sister used to have that
exact same look on her face.

597
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,144
Guess when?

598
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,981
When she'd come home
alone late at night.

599
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,234
Whatever.

600
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,702
Ha-rin, let's go.

601
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,129
Today's class is going to be fun.

602
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,089
You can look forward to it.

603
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,733
The performance test
for the PE final

604
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,276
is being replaced with dodgeball.

605
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,278
Target dodgeball.

606
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:25,738
Target dodgeball?

607
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,448
What's that?

608
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:28,866
This is the performance test?

609
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,618
FYI, the teacher has to work

610
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:32,787
on a trip itinerary
and won't be here.

611
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:33,954
But don't worry.

612
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:36,791
Our class rep will be
keeping score.

613
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,959
The rules are simple.

614
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,838
Within
a time limit of 20 minutes,

615
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,924
those who earn six points

616
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,634
will get a perfect score
in the performance test.

617
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,552
If not, you get a zero.

618
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,932
You'll be graded
according to your scores.

619
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,810
You score by hitting the target.

620
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,063
To be more exact, the four Ds
who only got one vote each

621
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,273
in the Pyramid Game.

622
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,527
The performance test
is a group assault?

623
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,071
How can they be so shameless?

624
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,489
Target?

625
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:10,991
Why the Ds with only
one vote all of a sudden?

626
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,827
The rank to replace the F.

627
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,870
Without an F...

628
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:17,998
The fear that Ds could
end up like the F.

629
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,460
Get six points within 20 minutes.

630
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,171
A mission, limitations,
and an individual match...

631
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,715
This trio makes people
do crazy things.

632
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,177
They'll do anything to attack
anyone weaker than themselves.

633
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,054
Once they get into it,

634
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,223
they'll never be free
of the game.

635
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,144
Interesting.

636
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:56,745
Time out.

637
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,206
Why is our performance
test target dodgeball?

638
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,249
Was it the teacher's decision?

639
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,542
Of course not.

640
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,420
She said she'd leave it up to us,
so me and Ha-rin decided.

641
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:05,379
Why?

642
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,839
Because you two are As?

643
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,424
Wow, I'm so hurt.

644
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,884
I'm an A too.

645
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,389
Do you have
another idea?

646
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:18,142
I do.
The target.

647
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:21,353
We should include all the Ds.

648
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,771
SUGGEST MAKING ALL DS THE
TARGET 1 POINT IF YOU HIT A D

649
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,898
3 POINTS IF YOU
HIT DS WITH ONE VOTE

650
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,608
One point if you hit a D.

651
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:28,444
Three points if you hit a D
with one vote.

652
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:29,570
What?

653
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:30,487
Why?

654
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,572
What are you doing, Ye-rim?

655
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:32,990
Why us...

656
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,452
There are 12 Ds
who got more than two votes.

657
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,912
That's too much.

658
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,832
I can't let those 12 target
the weak who only got one vote.

659
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:45,169
That's what Ha-rin wants.

660
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:49,381
She's trying to stop the
group assault on the one votes?

661
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,799
Not that it'll do any good.

662
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,426
What should we do?

663
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,095
It's hard to say no
to an A.

664
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,597
That's exactly why

665
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,266
Su-ji is putting Ye-rim forward.

666
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:03,729
Fine.

667
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,650
Three balls
will be used to play.

668
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,777
As, Bs, Cs,

669
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,112
Ds, then Ds with one vote

670
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,864
will stand in the circle
in that order.

671
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,158
If you step on the line,
it'll be minus two points.

672
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:17,993
Should we begin?

673
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,868
PE FINAL, PERFORMANCE TEST SCORES
GU SEOL-HA +3

674
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,416
JEONG YEON-DU +1

675
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,398
Five minutes before total chaos.

676
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,413
Shit!

677
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:41,762
Throw it!

678
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,764
Damn it, let go!

679
00:44:45,182 --> 00:44:46,558
Let go!

680
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,269
Pandemonium.

681
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,357
This is exactly what
you wanted, right?

682
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,419
Geez, dumb athlete.

683
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:14,378
So annoying.

684
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,964
Maybe we shouldn't have allowed
the one votes to touch the ball.

685
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,632
We're all in this game together.

686
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,970
Eun-jeong is doing her part.

687
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,562
Oh, inducing anger.

688
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:33,981
Damn you, Ji-ae.

689
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,941
Stop throwing it to Eun-jeong,
you dummy.

690
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,359
Ow, shit.

691
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,662
The climax.

692
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:09,308
Ja-eun, minus two points.

693
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:40,047
Hey, pass the ball!

694
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,757
I only have three points!

695
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:42,883
Shit!

696
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,885
Holding on to the ball
is a foul, isn't it?

697
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,597
First, take possession
of all the balls.

698
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,057
Then put the game on hold.

699
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,860
She wouldn't...

700
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,102
Well, Do-ah?

701
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,937
Record my three points.

702
00:47:38,438 --> 00:47:39,773
SEONG SU-JI +3

703
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,359
Do-ah!
Why are you writing that down!

704
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,902
Don't tap them with the ball!

705
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,070
Hit them!

706
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,780
That wasn't part of the rules.

707
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,490
Three balls are used to play.

708
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:50,367
As, Bs, Cs, Ds,
then Ds with one vote

709
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,244
will stand in the
circle in that order.

710
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,453
Minus two points
if you step on the line.

711
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:54,663
Score six points
and you get a perfect grade

712
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,124
on the performance test.
Those were the rules.

713
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:04,548
Enough.

714
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,966
Shit!

715
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,620
Da-yeon, Ja-eun, one point.

716
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,750
Just now, Da-yeon

717
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,670
not only openly
rebelled against an A,

718
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,048
she turned everyone against her.

719
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,510
We have the upper hand now.

720
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,186
You want the ball?

721
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,091
Ja-eun, thanks for earlier.

722
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:13,802
Who does Da-yeon think she is?

723
00:50:13,927 --> 00:50:15,929
She almost broke my bones.

724
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:18,932
When did the four of you
become friends though?

725
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,268
-Uh?
-Do you play any sports, Ja-eun?

726
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:22,769
Basketball? Volleyball?

727
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:24,229
No, I don't.

728
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:28,442
Are you really going
to get rid of the game?

729
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:38,493
Don't tell anyone
I reached out.

730
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:40,537
I'm really sorry,
Su-ji. I really am.

731
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,749
If I side with you guys,
it won't hurt me, will it?

732
00:50:50,964 --> 00:50:52,299
Where's Ja-eun?

733
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:53,592
She's changing.

734
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,635
-And Ye-rim?
-She's changing too.

735
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:59,973
Three club sandwiches,
and one BLT salad to go, please.

736
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,558
All on honey oat bread
with all the veggies,

737
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:02,642
and your recommended sauce.

738
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,311
Got it.

739
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:11,985
Look, Su-ji.

740
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,530
I know you don't totally trust me,

741
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,658
but once I make a decision,
I don't go back on it.

742
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,663
I'm just saying.

743
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,503
When is Monsta X
making their comeback?

744
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,338
Next month!

745
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,339
I'm going to group
purchase their album.

746
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,674
You want in on it?
Who is your bias?

747
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,343
Hyung-won.

748
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:38,428
He's got the best body.

749
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,471
You perv.

750
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:41,348
Hyung-won has the best face.

751
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:44,351
-I see. You go for faces.
-Hmph.

752
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,269
Your sandwiches are ready.

753
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,565
I'm starving.

754
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,609
Let's eat here.

755
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,657
Good, right?

756
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,117
This combination is
the best of the best.

757
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:02,536
Yeah, it's good.

758
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,037
So, your bias is Hyung-won.

759
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,497
Who do you like next?

760
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:07,874
-Min-hyuk!
-Oh, Min-hyuk!

761
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,169
Wow, I don't believe this.

762
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,213
I've found my buddy.

763
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,798
Do you want to go to
M Countdown together?

764
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,216
No.

765
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,718
Come on, let's go!

766
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,512
If you go, I'll buy you a combo!

767
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,861
Wow, that was tougher
than dance practice.

768
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,280
It's going to go online tomorrow.

769
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:40,490
The evidence we recorded.

770
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,076
Tomorrow?

771
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:52,794
Oh, sorry.

772
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:54,254
I just thought of Ye-rim.

773
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:57,090
Did you see her face
when she caught the ball?

774
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:00,385
Even that face can
look a little ugly.

775
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,137
I've seen the possibilities.

776
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,849
Yeah, I'm human after all.

777
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,267
I agree.

778
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,896
-Su-ji, you looked like a squid.
-Shut up.

779
00:53:10,979 --> 00:53:12,606
You two have become close.

780
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,024
You shut up too.

781
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,401
Don't be jealous, Ja-eun.

782
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,236
My bias is you now.

783
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,280
My number one pick
and bias wrecker.

784
00:53:47,349 --> 00:53:48,642
I'm sorry.

785
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,477
I just lost it for a sec.

786
00:53:52,437 --> 00:53:54,105
I'll make it up to you, Ha-rin.

787
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:06,326
This is Ha-rin.

788
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,621
Da-yeon just made a huge mistake.

789
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,498
She needs to be scolded, sir.

790
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:16,127
Here, it's your dad.

791
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,213
Hey...

792
00:54:26,054 --> 00:54:27,389
What?

793
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:22,569
Go to the hospital.

794
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,155
For your ankle.

795
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,240
Dummy.

796
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,875
Click.

797
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,128
You two are still friends?

798
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,381
Keeping your distance
did seem to mean something.

799
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,761
So, to Eun-jeong,

800
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,972
Ye-rim and swimming still matter.

801
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,766
When's the competition?

802
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,770
Why? So you can
spread rumors before it starts?

803
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,188
That she likes girls?

804
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,899
Well, you can't.

805
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,109
If you do, I'm going to tell
everyone you're a psychopath.

806
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,903
Or are you going
to use your money?

807
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:06,780
Don't.

808
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:08,239
I have plenty of money too.

809
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:11,618
Why do you think my parents
never come on Parents' Day?

810
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:13,912
Because they don't need
to suck up to Baekyeon Group.

811
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,622
Your methods

812
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:17,832
won't work on me.

813
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,002
I heard your parents don't want
you to become an idol singer.

814
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:23,004
And that's why you're not
on good terms with them.

815
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,465
If your debut falls
through this time,

816
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,051
you won't get another
chance on your own.

817
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,970
Isn't that right?

818
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,723
-Right, Ye-rim?
-Damn you.

819
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:35,642
Give it your best shot.

820
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,355
What are you doing?

821
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,023
What are you doing?

822
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,108
Get up.

823
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,692
Get up, now!

824
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:46,319
Get up!

825
00:56:46,402 --> 00:56:48,029
Don't do this, Eun-jeong.

826
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,572
Get up!

827
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,908
How touching.

828
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,161
I'll be keeping an eye
on you from now on.

829
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,706
Ye-rim. Don't make
Eun-jeong kneel again.

830
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,166
Damn you...

831
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:05,171
What is up
with that bitch, Ha-rin?

832
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,507
Now you ask?

833
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:08,967
I wasn't interested before.

834
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,312
There's another invisible
pyramid within the As.

835
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:24,649
This is Ha-rin.

836
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:28,444
Let's assume that out of the
21 girls who vote for Ha-rin,

837
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:29,737
nine vote for someone else,

838
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,781
and she loses her A status,
and this game stops.

839
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,827
If you multiply 1/2 nine times
over that comes to is 1/512.

840
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,997
Even if this game disappears
by a 1/512 chance,

841
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,874
the pyramid will still exist.

842
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,753
That's why we do
what Ha-rin says.

843
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,050
And that's why
I was relieved.

844
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,468
Do-ah, you're back
to being cute again.

845
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,221
It makes me sick.

846
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,765
How's Da-yeon?

847
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,976
Probably getting beat up.

848
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,352
Her dad is trash.

849
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:04,522
You bitch!

850
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,733
It's all your fault!

851
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,236
I won't do it again.
I'm sorry.

852
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,905
-I'm sorry.
-Sit up straight, damn it.

853
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,330
You're back.

854
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,333
Let me...

855
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,923
Why don't we send her abroad?

856
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:31,007
I'm sure my mother
would be okay

857
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,258
with sending her
to boarding school.

858
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:34,135
Your mother is not the problem.

859
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,142
Ha-rin has proof that
you laundered money

860
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,936
through the school's foundation.

861
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:48,441
What does my mother see in her...

862
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,901
She's a psychopath.

863
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,779
Even if she is our daughter.

864
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,465
Did you record
more evidence today?

865
00:59:12,548 --> 00:59:14,467
This is my evidence.

866
00:59:14,550 --> 00:59:15,927
The recordings?

867
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,391
How did she know?

868
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,787
I think I deserve to be back in.

869
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:51,337
Do-ah, you're back
to being cute again.

870
00:59:53,172 --> 00:59:54,507
Seo Do-ah.

871
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:56,592
You didn't ignore it this time.

872
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,848
BAEKYEON GROUP'S MENTORING PLAN

873
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,269
What is that?

874
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:09,022
Baekyeon Group's PR team
contacted the unit.

875
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,315
The Chairman

876
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,525
seems to be interested
in social work.

877
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,987
If you release your evidence.

878
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:17,572
This is how I'll use mine.

879
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,198
LIEUTENANT COLONEL
SEONG OF UNIT 6694

880
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:21,701
USES HIGH SCHOOL DAUGHTER
TO FORM TIES WITH A CONGLOMERATE

881
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,706
MADE DAUGHTER TRANSFER SCHOOLS
TO MAKE A PERSONAL CONNECTION

882
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,002
LIEUTENANT COLONEL'S CORRUPTION
BEHIND MENTORING PROGRAM

883
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:39,260
CORRUPT LIEUTENANT COLONEL'S
PERSONAL INFO EXPOSED

884
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,683
There's more.

885
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,894
Can you anticipate

886
01:00:49,562 --> 01:00:50,396
how far I'll go?

887
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,357
Why are you trembling, Su-ji?

888
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:57,195
Hey. Su-ji.

889
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,841
It hasn't expired yet.

890
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,051
What do you want to do?

891
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:22,303
You collected it, so you decide.

892
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,847
This is the recycle bin.

893
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:30,436
The reason I trembled
in front of Ha-rin that day...

894
01:01:30,561 --> 01:01:31,896
You are

895
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,607
the Pyramid Game.

896
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:36,943
This was why.

897
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,955
DELETE

898
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,104
Because of fear.

899
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:19,402
PYRAMID GAME
