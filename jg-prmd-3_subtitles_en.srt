SEONG SU-JI 5 VOTES

4
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,476
What...
Why am I a C?

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,771
Five votes?
Then what about Ja-eun?

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,524
MYEONG JA-EUN 2 VOTES

7
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,783
Someone voted for us.

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,326
But who?

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,287
What is it?

10
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:42,459
PYO JI-AE 0 VOTES

11
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:45,545
Why is Ji-ae an F?

12
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:47,672
This wasn't the plan.

13
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,257
That means...

14
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,471
PYO JI-AE 0 VOTES

15
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,065
Not me or Ja-eun, but Ji-ae?

16
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,526
SEONG SU-JI 5 VOTES

17
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,487
Who voted for me?

18
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,239
I don't know what's going on
but for now...

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,993
This is good.
You and I got out of it.

20
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,495
But why...

21
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,163
Why Ji-ae...

22
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,332
-What happened?
-It's obvious, isn't it?

23
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:24,000
She had a falling
out with her bestie.

24
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,006
That must've been the reason.

25
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,674
Did Da-yeon rough you up a lot?

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,676
I'm so mad.

27
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,179
This is the Fs fault!

28
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,056
One of them realized

29
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,016
that even best friends
can turn on each other.

30
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,852
I told you it'd be easy
to come between them.

31
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,646
To sum up,

32
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,690
Seung-ie got herself new friends.

33
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,902
And Ji-ae lost her only friend.

34
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,613

36
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:02,372
Seung-ie.

37
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,708
You didn't vote for me?

38
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,052
She crossed the line.

39
00:02:16,135 --> 00:02:17,554
Myeong Ja-eun got two votes?

40
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,097
Since when did she play?

41
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,892
She must've gotten ideas
because of the new girl.

42
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:25,854
What should we do
about this, Ha-rin?

43
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,404
Wu-ie, what are
you talking about?

44
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,406
Why are you asking me?

45
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,824
Huh?

46
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:52,672
Seung-ie, how could
you do this to me...

47
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:54,507
Seung, come on.

48
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:55,758
We're going to the restroom.

49
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,594
You're talking to an F?

50
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,137
No.

51
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,105
What can we do
to help Ji-ae?

52
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,983
Any ideas?

53
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:15,528
If the three of us
refuse to play...

54
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,370
-You liar.
-What?

55
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,456
I have a rough idea
of who you are now.

56
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,957
You're...

57
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,834
You're trying to pull out,
aren't you?

58
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,337
Stop trying to come up with
an excuse. I know you.

59
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,671
You don't care anymore,
is that it?

60
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,966
She can be smart
when she wants to be.

61
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,511
You know,

62
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,972
I'm not a good person like you.

63
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,140
I'm very ordinary.

64
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:48,478
This game? I wouldn't have
even cared if I hadn't been an F.

65
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,564
So, why should I help her?

66
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,607
You're an F!

67
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,900
Don't talk to her.
Let's go.

68
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,903
She was self-centered
and so am I.

69
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,988
That's not a crime.

70
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,326
You said you wanted
to destroy the game.

71
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,578
Everything you just said
is an excuse.

72
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,539
Making excuses won't change
a thing. I know.

73
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,709
Keep your promise, Su-ji.

74
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:13,336
You said
you wanted to change this class.

75
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,755
Ja-eun. I'm sorry.

76
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,466
Things are different for me now.

77
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,218
I'm...

78
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,720
no longer an F.

EPISODE 3

84
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,726
Congratulations, Su-Ji.

85
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,566
I know it was rough.

86
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,735
Even though it wasn't your fault.

87
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,486
That won't happen again.

88
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,280
I'll help you out this time.

89
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,032
Help me?

90
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:27,160
No, wait. I'm a C.

91
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,578
My rank is a C now.

92
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,205
It doesn't matter if she's
the ringleader or a psycho.

93
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:34,459
I don't have to be
hostile to her anymore.

94
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,460
Thanks.

95
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:39,213
I feel much better hearing that
from someone who's always an A.

96
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,051
You're the first person
who jumped up two levels

97
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:45,011
from an F.

98
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,259
Damn, I got an F all over my shoe.

99
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,733
Thanks.

100
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,412
Stop it, Da-yeon.

101
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,331
Do-ah...

102
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,999
Did you forget the rules?

103
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,961
Hazing the F starts the day
after the vote.

104
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:01,712
Recess is over.

105
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,256
Go back to your seats.

106
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,873
I'm paying you back.

107
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,713
That'll be 2,200 won.

108

This is Yu-rim. I'm inviting
you to the B-D group chat.

111
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,191
Want to go to school
together tomorrow?

112
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:04,525
Morons.

113
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,484
School friends?

114
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,486
Just classmates.

115
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,864
Thanks for the invite.

116
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:13,534
Girls like this are
sneaky and selfish.

117
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,578
But starting today,
I'm no different.

118
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,996
Why?

119
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,456
Because it's safer that way.

120
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,833
Then, who is in danger
instead of you?

121
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,755
Hello.

122
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,428
Wow, it's Su-ji. Congrats
on joining the group chat.

123
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,014
Actually, I've been wanting
to be friends with you.

124
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,308
"A guilty conscience
pricks the mind."

125
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,101
That's how the saying goes.

126
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,230
Who said it was because
a guilty conscience

127
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,898
is shaped like a triangle?

128
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,775
But for some guilty consciences

129
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,277
the pointy ends are so worn down

130
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,279
that they became a circle.

131
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,950
So it doesn't hurt
even if you're pricked by one.

132
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,660
Su-ji, hi!

133
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,662
We said hi on the group
chat yesterday.

134
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,497
Your bangs are so cute.

135
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,706
Where did you get your hair done?

136
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,625
I'm sorry about
the other time.

137
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,085
Let's make up.

138
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,046
You're not the type
who holds a grudge, are you?

139
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:11,467
F, who are you going
to vote for today?

140
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,802
Hey, F!

141
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,765
It's okay, I was an F then.

142
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,060
Wow, Su-ji, you're more
easy-going than I thought.

143
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,812
I know. So cool!

144
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,147
Totally my style.

145
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,649
What are you looking at?

146
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,484
Oh, Ha-rin?

147
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:30,403
I heard she's not
coming to school today.

148
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,946
Oh...

149
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,660
SKY HOUSE

150

Come play with us!

151
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,510
Show me your hand.

152

SKY HOUSE &amp; BAEKYEON GROUP
PATRONAGE DAY

153
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,037
Thank you.

154
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,875
Thank you.

155
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,126
What's your name?

156
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,419
It's Ah-yeon.

157
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,881
Oh, what a pretty name.

158
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,424
Ha-rin.

159
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,219
Doesn't she look just like you
when you were little?

160
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,889
What do you think?

161
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:42,933
I don't know, Mother...

162
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,858
Excuse me, I have some
business to take care of.

163
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,527
So foolish!

164
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,905
At work and at home.

165
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,034
Ha-rin is so much prettier.

166
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,702
I'm not saying that
just because she's my daughter.

167
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,454
She is pretty.

168
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:08,084
That's why I renovated
the entire school

169
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,420
to be ultra-modern
as a gift when she started!

170
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,634
That school is yours
until the day you graduate.

171
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,596
Do everything she wants for her.

172
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,807
That's why I made you
the director of that school.

173
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:23,891
Of course.

174
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,185
I'll take very good care of her.

175
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,109
I love you, Grandma.

176
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,445
I love the school.

177
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,365
BAEKYEON GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

178
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,285
Oh, hey Su-ji.

179
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:45,454
-Hi.
-Hi.

180
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:52,962
Oh, you go ahead.

181
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,463
Thanks.

182
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,112
Su-ji, that time I...

183
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,572
Fuck off.

184
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,177
SEONG SU-JI 5 VOTES,
MYEONG JA-EUN?

185
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,553
MYEONG JA-EUN 2 VOTES,
SEONG SU-JI?

186
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:50,895
How's school?

187
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:55,357
-Are things okay?
-Yes, I moved up a level.

188
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,609
In the mock SAT test.

189
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,694
I think I'll be able to
maintain my level in school too.

190
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,281
Grades aren't everything,
you know.

191
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:03,365
Schools...

192
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,451
Are a smaller version of society.

193
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:08,829
Yes.

194
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,082
So be good.

195
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,921
And if a problem arises
work it out and get through it

196
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,964
instead of trying to avoid it.

197
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,424
No, Dad.

198
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,134
I'm going to avoid it.

199
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,637
I'm going to do all that I can
to avoid it.

200
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,185
What are you doing?
What's so funny?

201
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,812
Ha-rin, listen to this. It's...

202
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,901
When you see the others
watching you get bullied,

203
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,403
don't you just want to
dig their eyes out?

204
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,407
They'll never know
the look in their eyes

205
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,409
when they look at the F.

206
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,246
What is that?

207
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,627
Are you not friends
with Ja-eun anymore?

208
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:58,671
That's too bad.

209
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,256
I voted for you two.

210
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,258
You voted for me?

211
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,553
-Why?
-Just because.

212
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:06,845
You don't believe me?

213
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,182
Then who among the lower ranks
do you think voted for you?

214
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,392
Let's say you did.

215
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,935
Why did you help me?

216
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,812
Is there something you want?

217
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,773
Wow, quick reaction.

218
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,942
You're funny.

219
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,860
Something I want?

220
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,028
I'm not sure.

221
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,446
Not really.

222
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,156
Ye-rim.

223
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,576
What's taking so long?

224
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,703
What are you doing with her?

225
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,497
Me? I'm a C like you.

226
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,292
Just kidding.

227
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,419
Anyway, thanks, Ye-rim.

228
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,635
She's not wrong.

229
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,514
The lower ranks have to give
any remaining votes to As or Bs

230
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,309
in order to keep the others
of similar rank in check.

231
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,899
Forget about the lower ranks.

232
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:03,694
Who among the As or Bs
would vote for me?

233
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,324
And why?

234
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:15,039
I'll get going then.

235
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,387
It almost flew off.

236
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,986
Let's move if you're done.

237
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,491
In the second semester
landscapes will count for 50,

238
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,909
and emoji designs another 50

239
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,702
for a total of 100.

240
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,454
You all know this, right?

241
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,039
Landscapes will be

242
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:59,291
relatively evaluated by you.

243
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,043
What's this?

244
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,337
With full marks being 50,
deduct five points each

245
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,257
to 45, 40, with 30
being the lowest score.

246
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,718
I'll be grading
based on your evaluations.

247
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,513
Focus on composition
and presentation.

248
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,932
Class rep, hand these out.

249
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,017
You'll be more at ease
without me around, right?

250
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,104
Mark them and bring it
to the office later.

251
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,898
Be good.

252
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,968
ART CLASS (LANDSCAPES) GRADES

253
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,808
You want the students
to evaluate each other?

254
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,937
Ha-rin wanted me
to give you this.

255
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,481
Baek Ha-rin...

256
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,358
BAEK HA-RIN 50

257
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,779
Mr. Im said this was
a relative evaluation,

258
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,906
but why don't we go
stand by the score

259
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,700
that we think we should get?

260
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,118
What?

261
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,454
What's going on?

262
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,464
Let's go.

263
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:35,471
Come on.

264
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,855
I'm a 35...

265
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,567
But this is included
in our school grade...

266
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:49,985
Hey.

267
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,585
Come on, we're 45.

268
00:18:28,106 --> 00:18:30,651
But Yu-rim,
aren't you on an art scholarship?

269
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,610
Huh?

270
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,612
No, this is where she should be.

271
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,822
We all promised.

272
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,532
This is where we all should be.

273
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,033
Right?

274
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,369
Ye-rim, what do you think
you're doing?

275
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,538
You think Cho Yu-rim's
drawing is good?

276
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,293
Yu-rim, say something.
Is that what you think too?

277
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,259
She does.

278
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,389
No.

279
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,433
I should be here.

280
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,643
Liar.

281
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,103
Wait a sec.

282
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,730
Cho Yu-rim, Ra Hae-jun are Ds.

283
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,065
Park Ji-Young is a C.

284
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,067
Im Ye-rim, Jeong Yeon-du are Bs.

285
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,571
Baek Ha-rin, A.

286
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,281
They're standing by rank.

287
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,742
A, B,

288
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,953
C,

289
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,664
D,

290
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,459
F.

291
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,130
Su-ji.

292
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:34,464
Don't just stand there.

293
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:35,799
Come over here.

294
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,509
How much does the ranks...

295
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,470
the pyramid, affect this class?

296
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,099
Nobody is threatening them
with a knife,

297
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,436
but they're willingly tanking
their school grades over this?

298
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,521
How bizarre.

299
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:52,232
So bizarre.

300
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:57,738
Am I really okay with this?

301
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:18,800
Woah, I was almost late.

302
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,636
Hi.

303
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:29,019
We'll now being
the 15th Pyramid Game.

304
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:39,905
SEONG SU-JI 0 VOTES

305
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,962
SEONG SU-JI 5 VOTES

306
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,592
I'm not okay.

307
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:05,055
I need to know
where I got the four votes.

308
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,183
IN CHARGE OF HANDING IN PAPERS
SEONG SU-JI

309
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,480
Guys, hang on a sec.

310
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,524
I have a suggestion to make.

311
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,026
The good thing about
getting a higher rank

312
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,362
is that it makes it possible
to stir things up.

313
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,157
This voting system with the app...

314
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,534
Don't you think it's
a little weird?

315
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,869
What? What are you
suddenly talking about?

316
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:28,787
What's weird about it?

317
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,746
Are you just being a troll?

318
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,123
You never thought
there was something off about it?

319
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,666
Not even once?

320
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,043
I heard the results
were almost always the same.

321
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,045
Especially with the As.

322
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,631
Am I the only one
who thinks it's weird?

323
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:43,760
You never suspected
that it could be tampered with?

324
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,599
Wait, Su-ji.
The app is totally reliable.

325
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:52,477
I made the app myself.

326
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,397
If anyone tries something,
it shuts down immediately.

327
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,565
Well,

328
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,608
what if you're a part of it too
as the developer?

329
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,609
How can we trust it?

330
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,903
Do you have any proof that
it's never been tampered with?

331
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,615
-OMG!
-How about we vote the old way?

332
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,993
We can write down the five names
we voted for in the 14th game

333
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,537
and count them to make sure.

334
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,581
Of course, it'll be anonymous.

335
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,541
I'm in.

336
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,209
Ye-won, what about you?

337
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,086
Okay, fine.

338
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,005
You're accusing my baby
of being tampered with?

339
00:22:20,338 --> 00:22:23,091
Su-ji, I'm disappointed in you.

340
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,677
You've insulted me.

341
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,430
If it was rigged, would I be a D?

342
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,389
Fine, let's do it.

343
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,432
Sounds fun.

344
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,767
If it's anonymous...

345
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,393
Honestly,
I did have my doubts.

346
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,478
How can I be a D?

347
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,521
Everyone thinks you're a D.

348
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,965
I'll count the votes then.

349
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,637
SHIM EUN-JEONG.
JEONG YEONG-DU,

350
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,013
MYEONG JA-EUN,
SEONG SU-JI, BAEK HA-RIN

351
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,435
Hey, it's exactly the same.

352
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,479
Wow, so lame.

353
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,065
Su-ju was just trolling?

354
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:23,652
See?
My baby is totally innocent.

355
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,780
Yeah, I'm sorry I doubted it.
I apologize.

356
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,908
Thanks for
participating everyone.

357
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,368
I'm on my way to
the teacher's office.

358
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,036
Did everyone hand
in their assignments?

359
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,210
You all did, right?
Then, I'm handing them in.

360
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:44,256
There was no twist after all.

361
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,549
This isn't a movie.

362
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,217
It's real life.

363
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,851
BAEK HA-RIN, KIM DA-YEON,
SEO DO-AH, BANG WU-IE, GU SEOL-HA

364
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,859
SHIM EUN-JEONG, JEONG YEON-DU,

365
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,819
MYEONG JA-EUN,
SEONG SU-JI, BAEK HA-RIN

366
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,532
You all did, right?

367
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,325
Then, I'm handing them in.

368
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,161
If I compare the handwriting,

369
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,038
I'll be able to figure out
who voted for whom.

370
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,388
KIM DA-YEON, BANG WU-IE
BAEK HA-RIN

371
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,558
I expected as much,

372
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,977
but these three
really voted for me?

373
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,896
I'm no longer an F

374
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,565
because it's what Ha-rin wanted?

375
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:47,402
If that psycho changes her mind,

376
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,197
I can always become an F again.

377
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,617
Damn it.

378
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,922
There's no guarantee they'll

379
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:08,590
vote for me again
in the next game.

380
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,175
What about Ye-rim?

381
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,385
She really voted for me
and Ja-eun this time.

382
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,513
She could vote for me again.

383
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,432
Yeah right.

384
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:19,100
Draw some dimples too.

385
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,776
Wow, so pretty.

386
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,945
Ji-ae, you are too cute.

387
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,201
Good girl.

388
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,620
That's right. Good girl.

389
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,372
Eat up.

390
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,084
-This?
-Animals can't talk.

391
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,341
That's enough.

392
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,009
That idiot.

393
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,844
She just can't stay out of it.

394
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,056
Unbelievable.

395
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,224
What do you think you're doing?

396
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,433
You're a D now, is that it?

397
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,143
Da-yeon, what do you
want me to do?

398
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,728
Ja-eun, Myeong Ja-eun...

399
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,522
Do you want to take her place?

400
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,315
You instead of Ji-ae.

401
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,866
You do whatever you want.

402
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,501
Give it to me.

403
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,046
Ja-eun, don't.

404
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,969
You can't do this to her.

405
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,472
Apologize.

406
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,850
Now.

407
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,353
BAEK HA-RIN

408
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,738
Oops, I missed.

409
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,781
I was aiming for Ja-eun.

410
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,742
I'm sorry, Ha-rin.

411
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,300
Are you okay?
I'm really sorry.

412
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,386
Why are you butting in,
you dummy?

413
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,679
You're too nice for
your own good.

414
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:22,307
-Crazy bitch, are you insane?
-Are you talking about yourself?

415
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,433
Do I still look like an F to you?

416
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,977
Yeah, so? I'm a B.

417
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:30,231
Only As or those with their
permission can mess with Fs.

418
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,233
Those are your rules.

419
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,694
And as you can see, I'm not an F.

420
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,489
And you're not an A, Wu-ie.

421
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,827
Let her go, Wu-ie.

422
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,164
Su-ji said it was a mistake
and apologized.

423
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,458
Let her go.

424
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,506
You're pretty smart, Su-ji.

425
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,216
Yes, I am.

426
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,926
And Ja-eun,

427
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,596
-I'll keep my promise.
-Promise?

428
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,932
Ja-eun and I agreed

429
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,726
not to bully the F,
I mean, Ji-ae.

430
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,979
Oh, is that okay?

431
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,232
Everyone seems to take
cues from you.

432
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,365
You must've gotten
the wrong idea.

433
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,368
There's no need to ask me.

434
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:26,162
I'm just one of the 25.

435
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:30,458
And you're one of us.
I'm not the one who judges you.

436
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,961
The game does.

437
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,143
Girls, I'm putting up
the literature...

438
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,564
What's with this mood?

439
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:53,982
Is something going on?

440
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,942
I'll put it up on the board.

441
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:58,778
Are you fighting?

442
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:01,114
No, we were just
in the middle of a game.

443
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,824
Next time,
just ask me to come.

444
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,119
You don't need to come here
during recess or lunch time.

445
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,038
All the other teachers do that.

446
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:15,336
Good luck, Su-ji.

447
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,173
Thanks, Da-yeon.

448
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,925
Damn it.

449
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,847
Oh.

450
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,608
Hey, give me your number.

451
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:46,659
Ah, it's been a while
since I've acted on impulse.

452
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:13,186
I had a feeling you'd be here.

453
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,439
I was wondering if you're okay.

454
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,237
Su-ji, if you're forcing
yourself to keep

455
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,905
your promise because of me...

456
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,115
Do you have an overinflated ego?

457
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,575
I thought you knew me.

458
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,452
You think I'm someone
who'd do this for you?

459
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,204
I'm doing this for me.

460
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,832
Ha-rin voted for me.

461
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,709
Ha-rin?

462
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:40,797
-How did you know?
-You don't need to know how.

463
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,674
I've concluded
I'd rather destroy

464
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,467
the game then
end up as an F again

465
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,303
while getting jerked around
by that psycho.

466
00:30:49,847 --> 00:30:52,517
So, this is just a deal.

467
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,022
Let's do this.
For real this time.

468
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,967
What's Ji-ae doing?

469
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,361
Stop crying.

470
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,822
That's enough.

471
00:31:47,905 --> 00:31:49,824
We've had it just as bad as you.

472
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,744
What? I'm not like you!

473
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,955
This was the first time anything
like this ever happened to me.

474
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,334
I was so scared.

475
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,836
My best friend betrayed me,

476
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:04,047
and I practically lost it.

477
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:07,133
How could Seung-ie do this to me?

478
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,387
But you!

479
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,014
How can you be so mean
to someone crying?

480
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:14,515
Don't you know how
to relate at all?

481
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,143
Are you some kind of sociopath?

482
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,190
You know, I feel sorry for you.

483
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,900
Seung-ie is a total bitch.

484
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,527
I don't want to ignore what
Da-yeon was doing it to him.

485
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:29,447
Best friends should
try to understand...

486
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,991
Come to think of it, betrayal
is written all over her face.

487
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,618
If she had been born 100 years
ago, she'd have betrayed...

488
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,287
She's mental, scum. She's like
the devil, sneaky as hell.

489
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,039
Okay, that's enough.

490
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:43,002
Then, should we keep talking?

491
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,837
-Su-ji.
-What?

492
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,631
You're so weird.

493
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,969
The class wasn't always this way.

494
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,180
There were more well-to-do
girls than most,

495
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:57,392
but the class atmosphere itself
was pretty ordinary.

496
00:32:58,768 --> 00:32:59,769
But then...

497
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,229
1 YEAR AGO

498
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:05,066
Class rep, we're bored.
How about we all play a game?

499
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,818
That's how it all started.

500
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:07,902
Kim Da-yeon?

501
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:08,986
Not Baek Ha-rin?

502
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,071
Ha-rin?

503
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,073
No, Ha-rin did nothing...

504
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:14,075
She just looked on.

505
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,786
Vote for the girls
you felt grateful

506
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,204
for during the past month.

507
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:21,958
The girls who get the most votes
will get a small benefit.

508
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,751
Not being on class duty
during exam periods.

509
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,712
Getting to choose the order
of performance assessments.

510
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,089
Getting to eat first
during lunch.

511
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,384
The benefits gradually changed.

512
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,468
It's Day 1 today.

513
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,762
Oh no.
Poor thing.

514
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:38,433
-Are you okay? If you curl up...
-Stop being such a pain!

515
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,439
I'm sorry.

516
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,024
The benefit to look down on girls

517
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,860
who were of a lower rank.

518
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,320
That's when the mood shifted.

519
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,158
There was discrimination,
and violence...

520
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,784
Hang on a sec.

521
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,078
These weren't the rules
to begin with,

522
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,289
but it evolved as you went?

523
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,331
Huh?

524
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:06,043
Oh, yeah, just naturally.

525
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,221
Being a monster rubs off.

526
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,057
"Being a monster rubs off."

527
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:24,020
Anyway, for a while
in the beginning,

528
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:28,316
you could bully anyone if they
were a lower rank than you.

529
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,652
And then...

530
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:34,071
The rank F was created.

531
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,740
What are you staring at?

532
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,168
Hey, F!

533
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,295
I'm sorry about swearing
at you earlier.

534
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,255
I apologized, okay?

535
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,925
The rule was made
that Fs were outcasts

536
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,594
and could only be bullied by As

537
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,514
or those with their permission.

538
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:03,476
There were no restrictions
about leaving a mark back then.

539
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,852
So, who was it?

540
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,354
CHO WU-RI 0 VOTES

541
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,525
Cho Wu-ri?

542
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:14,028
She's the one who was always
the F in your sophomore year?

543
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,738
What happened to her?

544
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,365
I don't know.

545
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:21,244
I don't think she was an F when
she moved up to the 11th grade.

546
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:24,539
But she dropped out a few months
before summer break.

547
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,879
YOUNGER SISTER

548
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:37,093
That's why they reassigned
the class numbers?

549
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,803
To delete she existed.

550
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:40,346
The video you showed me...

551
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,889
You got it from
someone too, right?

552
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,609
I'm sorry I didn't thank
you earlier.

553
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,403
I heard you're the one
who sent it to Ja-eun.

554
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,904
The video.

555
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,073
That's an edited version.

556
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,159
Only the As have the original.

557
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,370
Why did you help me?

558
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,125
"The highest form of penalty
will be applied

559
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:12,044
if the game is disclosed."

560
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:16,090
Why do you think
that condition was added?

561
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:17,758
For justification?

562
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,051
Not that it does any good.

563
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,053
You guys do whatever
you want anyway.

564
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:21,929
You're right.

565
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,682
I just thought
the justification was weak.

566
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:27,602
And I didn't want to see anyone
else's clothes get ripped off

567
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,936
just for that justification.

568
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:32,231
That's why you tried to keep me
away from the homeroom teacher?

569
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,733
Then what about during
the written vote?

570
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:37,236
You know I took them.

571
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,447
I did think it was careless.

572
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:42,283
I knew you wouldn't mention it
to anyone.

573
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:44,911
I heard you're the one who
came up with the rules for Fs.

574
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,954
Stopping when the bell rings.

575
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,456
That's to stop it from getting
out of hand.

576
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,541
Hazing begins the day
after the vote.

577
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,959
That's to prevent the F
from getting hurt too much

578
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,628
since everyone is too
worked up on that day.

579
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:55,421
-So?
-Will you help me?

580
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,798
I want to form an
alliance with the Ds.

581
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,679
Of course I'll help out
with the school board.

582
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,932
Principal Im will feel at ease

583
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:09,185
with you in charge.

584
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,941
Do-ah cares about
Ha-rin very much.

585
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,784
We parents should help
out in anyway we can

586
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,828
so that the girls
can build up trust.

587
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,497
They'll be friends
for life after all.

588
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,917
This time...

589
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,920
You're really sloppy.

590
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:38,172
I must have overestimated you.

591
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,841
-What?
-Why do you think I'll help you?

592
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,427
I don't have a reason to change.

593
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,972
And I have no intention
of undermining my position,

594
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,432
my power, or my relationships
based on mutual trust.

595
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,684
The rules?

596
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,687
The rules are there
to protect myself.

597
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,990
I don't ever leave
the circle I drew around myself.

598
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,366
That's my rule.

599
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,368
Rules, rules.

600
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,995
Rules are all you care about?

601
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:12,206
So you're saying
you won't help me?

602
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,291
-Ever?
-Ever.

603
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:18,170
You should be more careful.

604
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,964
An alliance with other Ds?

605
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,800
How many Ds do you think
have no connection

606
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,719
to the upper ranks?

607
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,304
I'm not sure if you'll be able
to convince them so easily.

608
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,182
After all, compared
to the upper ranks,

609
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,895
you don't have a lot
to offer the Ds.

610
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,026
How many Ds do you think
have no connection

611
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,736
to the upper ranks?

612
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,904
That means there are a few.

613
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,533
What? I thought she wasn't
going to help.

614
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:50,244
The one girl who was opposed
to the game in the past.

615
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,580
Maybe she was talking
about herself?

616
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,290
Hey, Do-ah.

617
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,754
What, those two?

618
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,756
What were they doing together?

619
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,429
She's a D, right?

620
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,889
Her family
owns Palm New Chemistry?

621
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,808
Yes, I heard in the restroom.

622
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,518
Stop pushing.

623
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:18,105
PALM NEW CHEMISTRY

624
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,733
QB GROUP ACQUIRES
PALM NEW CHEMISTRY

625
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,109
LOOKING FORWARD TO SYNERGY

626
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:27,323
-So this is why.
-Huh?

627
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:28,532
I've been thinking
it was strange.

628
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,117
Why were the girls not
in the upper ranks

629
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:32,286
going along with the game?

630
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:37,541
They can't fight back because of
how their parents are connected.

631
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,752
The new girl.

632
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,379
What was her name?

633
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,131
Seong Su-ji?

634
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,758
Eun-jeong,

635
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,802
I know you couldn't care less
about other people

636
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,303
but try to learn her
name at least.

637
00:39:49,386 --> 00:39:50,971
She's in our class.

638
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,224
You like her, don't you?

639
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,810
I can tell.

640
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,812
She's different.

641
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,397
Who else would provoke
Ha-rin like that?

642
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,652
Stop.

643
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,738
Just ignore her.

644
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,240
What?

645
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:11,992
Are you jealous?

646
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:15,454
Geez, are you nuts?

647
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,514
Oh my god.

648
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,516
You scared me.

649
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,685
You totally scared me.

650
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,187
I've never been here before
on a day off.

651
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,815
No one else is here. It feels
like we rented out the place.

652
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:45,359
Well, it is yours anyway.

653
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:47,945
I told you not to
talk about that, Yeon-du.

654
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,504
What brings you here?

655
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,548
I dropped by
on my way to clubbing with her.

656
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:10,259
Did you hear that our next
meeting is in Kota Kinabalu?

657
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,760
A night on a yacht.

658
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,637
With our parents.
Where's the fun in that?

659
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,556
Can you get to the point?

660
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,891
I need to study.

661
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:19,059
Such a straight-A student.

662
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,230
You do know that only
you, me, and Ha-rin

663
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,565
will last after graduation?

664
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,901
The other relationships
won't last.

665
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:30,196
We can't betray each other.

666
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,739
Whether you and I like it or not,

667
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,407
we have to see
Ha-rin our whole lives.

668
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,118
You're right. We'll never
be out of each other's lives.

669
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:40,206
-Exactly.
-But I'm not like you.

670
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,875
I don't play the game
because I want to.

671
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,211
I'm only doing what I can.

672
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,590
Thinking about it
makes me so mad again.

673
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:52,718
Always acting all snooty
and neutral.

674
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,054
You picked her
to be the game host

675
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,597
and she thinks
she's something.

676
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:59,558
Seo Do-ah better not betray us.
I'll make her regret it.

677
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,602
-Wu-ie.
-Yes?

678
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,354
Do you want me to
buy you this painting?

679
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,732
This?

680
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,442
Looks super expensive.

681
00:42:08,525 --> 00:42:10,694
You have to do
something for me though.

682
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:11,695
What is it?

683
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,782
I'm happy to do anything for you.

684
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:17,952
Then...

685
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,457
Can you please...

686
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,627
know your place?

687
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,879
Wu-ie, all her life,

688
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,799
Do-has been taught

689
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:33,801
to hold on to the power she has,

690
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,886
and her position

691
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,097
and the connections
based on trust.

692
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,766
Do you know what that means?

693
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:45,145
I overstepped.

694
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,022
I crossed the line.

695
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,985
Why would Do-ah betray you?

696
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:54,488
You and her are friends.

697
00:42:54,571 --> 00:42:55,948
Friends?

698
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,997
Is that what a friend is?

699
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,211
-A game?
-Yes.

700
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,337
1 YEAR AGO

701
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,674
I want a hierarchy in the class.
Like a pyramid.

702
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,510
Doesn't it sound fun?

703
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:22,099
We could decide our ranks
through a game.

704
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:24,852
Do-ah, what do you think?

705
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,939
Do you want to go ask your dad?

706
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:33,277
You're a good girl who always
listens to her dad, aren't you?

707
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,991
How are you going
to destroy the game?

708
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:40,284
With an alliance of Ds.

709
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,244
We can use the
desire to level up.

710
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,289
We'll get the Ds together
and make them all a C.

711
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,374
What? Me a C?

712
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:48,542
That got you interested, right?

713
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,085
That's the desire to move up.

714
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,421
No human is immune to it.

715
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,507
One person gets five
votes each, right?

716
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:59,887
I ran the numbers and the C
who had the least votes had five.

717
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:03,390
If we get three more Ds to
join us and vote for each other,

718
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:05,309
we'll all get more
than five votes each.

719
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,977
That'll make us all Cs.

720
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,979
Cs.

721
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,940
That'll make a total of 11 Cs.

722
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:15,652
There'll be more Cs than Ds.
Like this.

723
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,407
The pyramid will fall more
easily than we think.

724
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,202
If the Pyramid Game is no longer
shaped like a pyramid,

725
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,412
the game will be over.

726
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,915
So, my point is,
we have to get together

727
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,292
the Ds who'll move up
to being Cs with us.

728
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:33,879
Which three among the Ds?

729
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,547
Yeah, I'm wondering myself.

730
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,467
How do we find the girls who have
no ties to the upper ranks?

731
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:41,261
I don't know the girls that well.

732
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,846
Me neither.

733
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,647
Mr. Kim. I'm here on an
errand for Mr. Im.

734
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,190
Could you open
the cabinet for me?

735
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,109
Oh...

736
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:59,071
-Tidy up before you leave.
-I will. Thank you.

737
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,833
Yesterday was the last day
to finish up transcripts.

738
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:11,917
And Mr. Im was absent.

739
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,837
It was total chaos in the office.
I told Math I was doing an errand

740
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,296
and asked him
to open the cabinet.

741
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:19,466
Wow.

742
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,969
You really are
something else, Su-ji.

743
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:23,679
You're such a great liar too.

744
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,972
It's not that hard.

745
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,473
You just need to think quick.

746
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:28,517
It's easy when it's critical.

747
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,436
Sometimes...

748
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,313
You remind me of someone.

749
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:36,066
The way you think and act.

750
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,276
Who?

751
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:44,575
Whatever, it's easy
to tell now, right?

752
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,160
Tell what?

753
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,621
Homeroom wrote everything
we need to know in his notes.

754
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,291
I'm only going to
explain this once.

755
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,584
First of all, the Cs.

756
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,961
Ji-young's parents work
at Baekyeon Food

757
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,838
so she's connected to Ha-rin.

758
00:45:57,921 --> 00:45:59,256
Seon-ju's dad owns SJ Company

759
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:00,966
which is a subcontractor
for Da-yeon's family.

760
00:46:01,049 --> 00:46:02,301
There are more like them.

761
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,969
It's not important
so I'll move on.

762
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:06,847
Now for the Ds who
are important to us.

763
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,516
Yang So-young's parents are
doctors at Seosim Hospital.

764
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,351
Choi Yu-yeon gets a scholarship
from Baekyeon Group.

765
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,437
If we exclude everyone like them,

766
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,565
that leaves six Ds
we can approach.

767
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,901
Yoon Ye-won, Go Eun-byeol,
Cho Yu-rim,

768
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,777
Ra Hae-jun,
Song Jae-hyeon, Joo Seung-ie.

769
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,363
We just have to
pick three from them.

770
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,365
But not Go Eun-byeol.

771
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:26,700
She's crazy and
a pathological liar.

772
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:28,285
Not Joo Seung-ie either.

773
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,888
Wow, so this is C programming?

774
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,223
I've never actually
seen it before.

775
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,849
Are you writing malware?

776
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,268
No, this is just a hobby.

777
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:54,811
What?

778
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:55,938
You're suspecting
me of tampering again?

779
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:58,148
No, we proved that
the game was clean.

780
00:46:58,232 --> 00:46:59,900
Let's be cool, buddy.

781
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,277
I'm analyzing code.

782
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:04,196
Why, are you interested?

783
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,073
Can you tell the difference
between a hacker and a cracker?

784
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:07,115
Wow, my pride just took a hit.

785
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,285
Communicate through text only.

786
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,997
For now, Ja-eun and I have to
mingle more with the others.

787
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:15,666
That way,
we'll get an opportunity

788
00:47:15,749 --> 00:47:17,084
to bring them over to our side.

789
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,088
Hey, It's Shownu X Hyungwon.

790
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,172
They're live streaming
was awesome yesterday.

791
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,258
I love how Shownu dances.

792
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,094
You're a MONBEBE?

793
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:28,595
-You too?
-Me too!

794
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:29,471
Have you ever been
to their fan sign event?

795
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:30,430
Yes, of course.

796
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,891
-Really?
-You've never been?

797
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,771
So cute.

798
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:40,065
Huh?

799
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,109
Hey.

800
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,570
Who are they? They look funny.

801
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:48,031
What? Why are you picking
a fight over my boys?

802
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,166
Ye-rim, need this?

803
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,252
Oh, thanks.

804
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,847
-There's one more, right?
-There is.

805
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,564
For the second step,

806
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,108
whatever happens to Ji-ae,
we have to ignore it.

807
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,943
What? Why?

808
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,028
Then,

809
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,613
what am I supposed to do?

810
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:29,615
We're in this together.

811
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,658
We can't draw
any more attention to ourselves.

812
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,328
Make it look like we went our own
ways after trying to resist once.

813
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,495
MYEONG JA-EUN - OKAY

814
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,414
Ja-eun, are you making fun of me?

815
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,174
Wow.

816
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,677
-I got Dragonite.
-Huh? Can I have it?

817
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:56,933
This is for Ra Hae-jun.

818
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,935
I need it to strike up
a conversation naturally.

819
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:03,815
Hey, this is good!

820
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,359
It's good.

821
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,075
Come on out.

822
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,720
Hang on,
you better not ruin it.

823
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,389
Don't worry.
I'll save you 5,000 won.

824
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,390
Cut it like mine.

825
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:37,724
Absolutely not.

826
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,309
-Come on, just once.
-Don't cut it like Yu-rim's.

827
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:40,727
I'm cutting it for real now.

828
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:44,981
-Su-ji is good at this.
-Your turn now?

829
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,024
Yes!

830
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,069
Hi, nice day today.

831
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,738
"Hi, nice day today."

832
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,281
You sound like a robot.

833
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,158
Try to smile a little.

834
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,871
You look like Joker.
Don't smile. Just say this.

835
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:01,415
"Wanna go for malatang later?

836
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:02,332
It'll be on me."

837
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,584
-Malatang?
-Just repeat after me.

838
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,962
"Wanna go for malatang later?
It'll be on me."

839
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,672
"Wanna go for malatang later?
It'll be on me."

840
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,507
"Wanna go for malatang..."

841
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,518
Wait, Ja-eun.

842
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,277
I can't help but feel
something is going on.

843
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,028
You can talk to me.

844
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:37,117
Is anyone being bullied
in your class?

845
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,666
Well...

846
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,628
Uh...

847
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:49,921
Actually...

848
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,465
Hello.

849
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,927
Oh, Ha-rin.

850
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,432
Ja-eun, aren't you going to
change into your gym clothes?

851
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,435
Do-ah will lock the door again
if you're late.

852
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,064
Oh, right. Go to class.

853
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,816
We'll take this up
again next time.

854
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:17,324
You look tired. Is something up?

855
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,585
So, you've competed
at international

856
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,003
anti-hacking competitions?

857
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,380
Wow, I'm impressed.

858
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,592
By the way, how did you end up
making the Pyramid Game app?

859
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,803
I offered to make it.

860
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:40,722
Writing the names
and counting the votes by hand...

861
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:42,224
How primitive is that?

862
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,017
You offered?

863
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,644
But you're...

864
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:47,813
Oh...

865
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,440
Never mind.

866
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:51,441
What?

867
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:55,445
Bang Wu-ie who only drew
the logo is a B but I'm a D?

868
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,364
A sense of inferiority.

869
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:59,449
Being a D despite
creating the app...

870
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,201
There's a 99% chance
she's unhappy.

871
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,286
No, 100%.

872
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:06,915
Were you going to tell her?
To the literature teacher?

873
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:09,626
No, I would never tell.

874
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,545
I was only going to tell her
not to worry about anything.

875
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:12,546
Why?

876
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,383
She could be able to help.

877
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,760
It would only make things worse.

878
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,596
You wouldn't want

879
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,933
an anti-bullying
committee to be held.

880
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,227
You're worried about me?

881
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,229
In case I got into trouble?

882
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,399
Thanks.

883
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,694
But, then why?

884
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,613
Why did you get out
of being an F?

885
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,115
How dare you?

886
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,159
Why did you trade votes
with the new girl?

887
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,537
Hmm?

888
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,419
Ja-eun.

889
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,422
You know you can't do this to me.

890
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,282
NAME: YOON YE-WON

891
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,202
"Has a lot of pride
and the desire to be recognized.

892
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,621
Hates to lose,

893
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,915
but tends to comply
when it's to her benefit.

894
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,584
Seeks practicality
in friendships as well."

895
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,629
HOW ARE THINGS GOING?
COME TO THE ROOFTOP

896
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,923
What? She read my text
but why isn't she coming?

897
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,515
What's wrong?

898
00:53:47,807 --> 00:53:49,059
You look frozen.

899
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:50,518
Huh?

900
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,562
I'm fine.

901
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:57,484
How's the plan going?
Ji-ae keeps texting.

902
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,027
Oh...

903
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:00,737
PYO JI-AE
DON'T DO THIS TO ME

904
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,821
SEONG-MYEONG-PYO
HEY

905
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,698
I don't have enough info
on the girls.

906
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,408
Info...

907
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,329
It'd be simple if we could
hack their phones.

908
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,789
Hack?

909
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,332
You know how to hack?

910
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:14,334
Would I be here if I did?

911
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,835
I'd have done it already.

912
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:19,589
That's a crime.

913
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,384
Whatever.

914
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,640
I just need to be friends
with someone who can.

WINNER OF THE 35TH NATIONAL
COLLEGE ANTI-HACKING COMPETITION

916
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,084
Ye-won, do you want to do it?

917
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,336
Ye-won has a huge ego
and likes to show off.

918
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,713
She also likes a challenge.

919
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,133
She'd be less wary of you
who's a D than me who's a C.

920
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:05,593
We just need to find something
to persuade her.

921
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:08,138
Hey, Ye-won.

922
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:10,932
New laptop?
Looks nice.

923
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,268
-Is it a MacBook Pro?
-You know a lot about MacBooks?

924
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,644
I just know that it's expensive.

925
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:17,981
If you get the best graphic
card and memory

926
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,733
it's well over $10,000, isn't it?

927
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:20,734
That's the Mac Pro, right?

928
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,111
That's the new one
I have at home.

929
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,701
See you later in class.

930
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:32,245
Yeah, bye.

TENDS TO COMPLY
WHEN IT'S TO HER BENEFIT

937
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,966
Tends to comply
when it's to her benefit?

938
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,432
I just need to keep
an eye on her?

939
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,036
We're doomed.
