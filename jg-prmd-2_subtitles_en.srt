Where are you going?

00:00:13,221 --> 00:00:16,474
I never laugh, I never weep.

Wow.

00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:38,747
So pretty.

00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,790
Wow.

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:43,126
She's so fair.

11
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,130
Ha-rin, can I post
this on Facebook?

12
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,257
-It's a private account.
-Yeah.

13
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,341
Yes!

14
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,139

My bestie, love you!

Baek Ha-rin. The kind,
gentle, angelic looking girl.

00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:26,920
Please, please stop, Ha-rin.

19
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,737
How do you like the color?

20
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,241
Are you happy?

21
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,409
Ja-eun.

22
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:00,703
This must be paradise.

23
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,161
Are you okay?

24
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,221
You're not hurt?

25
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:09,772
That's enough, Da-yeon.

26
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,774
It's dangerous.

27
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,193
It was you, wasn't it?

28
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,530
The crazy bitch
who created this insane game.

29
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,949
Su-ji?

30
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,703
You want me to take you
to the nurse's office?

31
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,789
No, don't say anything yet.

32
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,043
I'm okay.
Thanks.

33
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,720
Doesn't Ha-rin
always look good in Chanel?

34
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,097
-It's Dior yesterday.
-She looks good in anything.

This is Hermès.

44
00:05:02,301 --> 00:05:04,679
It's a calfskin loafer

45
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:09,475
with an elegant fringe,
and the signature "H" detail.

46
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,103
The "H" buckle is

47
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:15,815
in rose gold
on a feminine fringe detail.

48

00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,245
Stop.

51
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,957
I'll do whatever you want.
Just stop it, please.

52
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,003
Do whatever you want with me.
Just don't bully the others.

Who?

56
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,010
You mean...

57
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,013
Seong Su-ji?

58
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,685
Ja-eun.

59
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,855
You're actually
worried about Su-ji?

60
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:06,949
Liar.

61
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,994
That's not who you are.

The meeting.

69
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,254
Oh, right.

70
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:07,510
During the juniors' mid-terms,

71
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,428
please let's try
to get through it

72
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,556
without any complaints
from the parents.

73
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:12,849
Okay?

74
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:15,643
-Got that?
-Yes, ma'am.

75
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,478
I'm counting on you.

76
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,397
Anything else we need to discuss?

77
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,859
-Anything?
-Well...

78
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:29,031
I think someone is being
bullied in my class.

79
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,327
It's my first time as a homeroom
teacher so I'm not sure...

80
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,079
Based on the
anti-bullying manual...

81
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh dear. Are the parents
of that student powerful people?

82
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,295
Oh dear. Are the parents
of that student powerful people?

83
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,546
Excuse me?

84
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,132
Oh, the victim?
No, she's from an ordinary...

85
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,217
What do you mean, "victim"?

86
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,054
You know how
celebrities and athletes

87
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,057
have their careers ruined
with even the mention

88
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,559
of having been
bullies in the past.

89
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,561
I always felt bad about that.

90
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,480
As an educator,
if you actually look into it,

91
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,399
most were just
harmless pranks as a teenager.

92
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,651
These kids have
a whole future ahead.

93
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,612
Do you really want
to bring them down?

94
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,947
Besides, determining
what's bullying

95
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,491
and what's not can be
so ambiguous.

96
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,869
If you say things
like that in public,

97
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,996
you could end up in
a lot of trouble, ma'am.

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,917
You never know
what teenage kids will do

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,877
if you try to
take care of things too hastily.

100
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,755
You should talk to the student
being bullied first.

101
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:31,344
I'm telling you,
they're just kidding around.

102
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,603
I just need to hang in there.

103
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,772
Just a little longer.

104
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:46,901
Already?

105
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,069
Gu Seol-ha, let her go.

106
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:50,988
Dang it.
We were just getting started.

107
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,462
Oh dear.
Her legs gave out.

108
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,514
Break is over.

109
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,140
Go back to your seats.

110
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:20,351
Okay.

111
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,197
I've learned a few things.

112
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,331
-Hi.
-Hello.

113
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,044
Settle down.

114
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:49,297
Are you ready to start class?

115
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,382
Recess is ten minutes.

116
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,092
Things are much easier to handle

117
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,761
if I can avoid them for
ten minutes. Funny isn't it?

118
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,639
Ten minutes during break,
60 minutes during lunch.

119
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,600
They only harass
me during that time.

120
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,853
They don't touch
me after school,

121
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,688
and make sure
never to leave a trace.

122
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:09,025
They can only go after Fs
if they're a level A

123
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,319
or have an A's permission.

124
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,904
The fact that
there are these blind spots

125
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,365
means that there
are rules to the game

126
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,950
and everyone follows them.

127
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,786
Were these rules made by

128
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,164
Baek Ha-rin as well?

129
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,545
It feels like everything
is set up for this game.

130
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:31,922
Even the fact that our class

131
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,091
is in a different building
from the others.

132
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,428
If this isn't a coincidence,

133
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,722
this isn't just the act
of Baek Ha-rin,

134
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,140
who's only a student.

135
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,893
"Nature blows your mind."

136
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,771
Nature blows your mind.

137
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,815
This means...

138
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,902
That it captivates your mind.

139
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:55,654
It engages you...

140
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,865
A conscience response
or a reflex.

141
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,575
Differentiating the two

142
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,995
depends on where
the order comes from.

143
00:11:04,663 --> 00:11:07,750
If your cerebrum
sends a signal, and you react...

144
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,381
That's a conscience response.

145
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,258
Do the teachers really not know?

146
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,052
When everything is so obvious?

147
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,597
Security cameras?

148
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,975
Being an ENTP-type
I'm naturally curious.

149
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,769
There are cameras
in the main building

150
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:27,937
but why don't we have any?

151
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,022
Your class is the only one there.

152
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,649
What's the point of
having cameras there?

153
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,526
Don't you think? Oh!

154
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,903
You have a human
security camera too. Do-ah.

155
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,614
That girl is so dependable.

156
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:41,450
Her family runs Seosim Hospital
so no wonder she's so different.

157
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,454
I wish I had her in my class.
I'm so jealous.

158
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,289
Seosim Hospital?

GU SEOL-HA WINS BRONZE

SEOUL IN GIRLS' JUDO

169

AT NATIONAL JUNIOR
SPORTS COMPETITION

170
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:18,547
Judo? No wonder...

175
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,229
BAEKYEON GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

A SURPRISING NETWORK
OF GOLDEN CONNECTIONS

177
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,236
SIM EUN-JEONG, IM YE-RIM,
YOON YE-WON, JEONG YEON-DU

178
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:44,532
Wow, this is no joke.

179
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,868
How can they all be in
the same class?

180
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,912
What is with this class?

181
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,082
In today's society,
both the rich and the poor

182
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:55,876
carry Chanel bags and drive BMWs.

183
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,004
The class difference nowadays
comes from people's manners.

184
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,966
The virtues you need to inhabit
should be respect,

185
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:05,427
politeness, honesty,
responsibility, and care.

186
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:08,013
The proof of one's high
class will show when people

187
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,350
have small talk or how they treat
service workers in restaurant

188
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,353
or when they make small purchases
with black cards.

189
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,689
You better come home early today.

190
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:18,274
If you're not here,
who's going to be on

191
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,733
the receiving end of
Dad's baseball bat?

192
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,236
People, be kind.

193
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,239
Seung-ie, can you come with me
to buy a used item today?

194
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,949
I found the stickers I wanted!

195
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,076
Can't you just buy a new one?

196
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,411
Fine.

197
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,289
-Yes! You'll come with me?
-Sure.

198
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,292
Seung-ie.

199
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,835
Come over here a sec.

200
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,535
You want some vitamins?

201
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,329
I'm good.

202
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,082
Did you know?

203
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,002
That Kim Da-yeon was the
youngest daughter of QB Group?

204
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,962
Oh, you didn't?

205
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,215
There are a lot of special
kids in our class.

206
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,675
Oh...

207
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:29,678
Do you mind if
I ask you something?

208
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,306
Since I have no
one else to talk to.

209
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,600
Sure.

210
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,934
What is it?

211
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:38,729
Who do you think made this game?

212
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:42,524
I mean, why do you think they
made a crazy game like this?

213
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,948
Oh, am I the only one curious?

214
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,077
Just hypothetically,
if it had been you,

215
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,995
why would you have made it?

216
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:02,044
For fun.

217
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,588
Fun.

218
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,341
When you see the others
watching you get bullied,

219
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:10,052
don't you just want to
dig their eyes out?

220
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:14,973
They'll never know
the look in their eyes

221
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,725
when they look at the F.

222
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,894
I'd want to dig their eyes out
and show them.

223
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,898
Oh, but then, I guess they
wouldn't be able to see at all.

224
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,611
That means, they'll never know.

225
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,907
Isn't that funny?

226
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,246
If that's what they're thinking,
that would be so scary.

227
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,706
Right?

228
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,083
Yeah...

229
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,753
Sounds like a psychopath.
Just got the chills.

230
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,589
I've been thinking...

231
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,759
Why me though?

232
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,761
They already have
Myeong Ja-eun, so why?

233
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,972
Just to stomp out
any potential defiance

234
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:57,015
because I'm new?

235
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,686
Who knows?

236
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,606
But Su-ji,

237
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,779
it's not your fault.

238
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,872
Baek Ha-rin...
You're more bizarre

239
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,415
than I imagined.

240
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,625
Can I honestly say
going after her

241
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,503
would be easier
than persuading Ja-eun?

242
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,132
Absolutely not.

243
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:33,218
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

244
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,637
Why do you keep disappearing
during every recess?

245
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,306
Do you have any idea
what it does to the rest of us?

246
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,641
Because of you and
Ja-eun, Seung-ie...!

247
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:43,562
If we get bullied instead of you,
it'll be on you!

248
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,694
Are you out of your mind?

249
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:51,695
What?

250
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,155
Why is that on me?

251
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,656
You guys hate being
bullied so much

252
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,575
but you expect me to just take it

253
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,202
while they beat
me and torture me?

254
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,828
Why should I let them
just so you guys can be safe?

255
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,163
Because you're an F!

256
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,581
You're a lower rank than us!

257
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,249
If you think that sucks,
try to up your level!

258
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,168
Pyo Ji-ae!

259
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:16,637
Ah, I should just
keep my head down.

260
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,180
Girls like Go Eun-byeol
could get scared

261
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,640
and back down if I keep this up.

262
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,184
I don't have time to deal with
wimps like this.

263
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,604
I need at least two votes
until the next vote.

264
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,189
The best scenario right now is

265
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,651
for Eun-byeol, Ja-eun
and me to trade votes.

266
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,071
That'll put us above Pyo Ji-ae
and Joo Seung-ie who are Ds.

267
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:37,199
Hey, we're not done here!

268
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,118
Myeong Ja-eun
is the only way.

269
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,920
I don't know what I did wrong.

270
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,756
School feels like hell,

271
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,009
and I can't bring
myself to tell my dad.

272
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,888
Su... Su-ji...

273
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,473
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:02,891
What I said to you about filing
a report or transferring...

275
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,561
I guess I spoke too easily
since it wasn't happening to me.

276
00:19:06,144 --> 00:19:08,772
And my plan
to bring someone else down...

277
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:11,483
That was so mean.

278
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,444
I was just so desperate.

279
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,989
Can you just do me one favor?

280
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,325
You and I should
vote for each other.

281
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,327
That's okay, isn't it?

282
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,416
Fall for it, naive and
innocent Myeong Ja-eun.

283
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,258
I can't.

284
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:39,261
Uh, I mean...

285
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:42,139
I just don't play that game.

286
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,434
What? Why not?

287
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,939
Sorry. I'm sorry.

288
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,442
What?
A burn bandage?

289
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,902
Were you...

290
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:58,906
This is a cigarette burn,
isn't it?

291
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,116
-Did Baek Ha-rin do this?
-No. No.

292
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:02,659
Yeah, right.

293
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,329
You always smelled of cigarettes

294
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,080
and I thought it was strange.

295
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,208
You sure have an unlimited
amount of tolerance, don't you?

296
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,629
By any chance, you're not
a masochist, are you?

297
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,800
Ja-eun, are you okay with the
way things are? Are you happy?

298
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,387
I know you're in so much pain,
that you do this to yourself.

299
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,140
I know you want this to stop.
Am I wrong?

300
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,319
Whatever, I can't do it.

301
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,740
What don't you try asking
Seung-ie and Ji-ae?

302
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,785
I'll ask them for you,
if you want.

303
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,036
What?

304
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,246
Who would ask who?

305
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,999
Seung-ie and Ji-ae are both nice.

306
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,543
They even talk to me sometimes.

307
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,380
And Seung-ie is nice about
lending you stuff.

308
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:57,464
She doesn't swear either.

309
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,007
When the others
ask her for favors,

310
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,176
she does them
without ever getting mad.

311
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,178
So, if you ask her...

312
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,973
Oh, I see.

313
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,308
She must be really nice.

314
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,726
But do you know

315
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:12,646
the difference between being
nice and being a doormat?

316
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,314
You want me to show you?

317
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,691
What?

318
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,360
Piss off!
I don't owe you a vote.

319
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,195
You should be apologizing to us

320
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:22,030
for getting
bullied instead of you.

321
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,366
-How shameless can you be?
-Forget it, Seung-ie.

322
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:27,077
-Don't bother talking to her.
-You're nuts. I'm no doormat!

323
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:29,037
You're an F. Do you think
we're on the same level?

324
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,622
You're crazy.

325
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,249
-Let's go.
-Geez!

326
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,584
See?

327
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,253
And you thought they were nice?

328
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,088
Because they didn't
bully you outright?

329
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,881
Those girls... Actually,

330
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,884
the entire class probably
wants you to be the F.

331
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,678
As long as possible.

332
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,014
That's the only way they survive.

333
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,891
That's how humans are.
It's the smart thing to do.

334
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,727
And you. You're not the nice
girl. You're just a doormat.

335
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,353
Get your head
on straight, Ja-eun.

336
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:54,521
From this point on,

337
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,232
just focus on getting
out of being the F with me...

338
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,030
What the...?
Did her feelings get hurt?

339
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,573
I should go.

340
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,950
Hey!

341
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:17,294
All the girls were in
the same class last year as well.

342
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,796
They were all in class 1-5
in their sophomore year.

343
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:25,594
Only Ja-eun and me were
new to the class.

344
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,012
Class 1-5?

345
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,932
So that's why it was
the 13th game.

346
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,437
That means it started
around June last year.

347
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,647
By the way, Su-ji...

348
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:40,275
You didn't tell Ja-eun
about me, did you?

349
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,694
Eun-byeol is just the same
as the others.

350
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,446
She pretends to care
about Ja-eun,

351
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,074
but won't do anything to help.

352
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,284
I don't have an ulterior motive.

353
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:52,412
I just don't want
Ja-eun to be upset.

354
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,958
I'm no different.

355
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,794
If I tell Ja-eun about Eun-byeol

356
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,587
and the two make up,

357
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,422
I could be left out in the cold.

358
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,341
Like I said,

359
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,009
this is how humans are.

360
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,178
Humans are all

361
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,972
selfish and self-centered,
Ja-eun.

362
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,951
DAD

363
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,830
TRAINING AN ELITE REGIMENT
THAT WINS IN BATTLE / UNIT 6694

364
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,206
Oh, hey.

365
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:38,667
-Here.
-Thanks.

366
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,668
See you at home.

367
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,045
About changing schools...

368
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,589
Oh, did the date move up?
When are we leaving?

369
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:45,966
You don't have to change
schools anymore.

370
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:49,010
-What?
-My work got extended.

371
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,012
You'll be able to graduate
at this school.

372
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,431
You'll be a senior next year
so this is good.

373
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:54,891
See you.

374
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,104
No, Dad.

375
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:03,024
I'm totally fucked.

376
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:04,943
Seo Do-ah.

377
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,903
Myeong Ja-eun.

378
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,198
Ja-eun is absent again today?

379
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,450
Sheesh.

380
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,204
Okay, open your books...

381
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,831
I made a mistake that day.

382
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,583
You're not the nice girl.
You're just a doormat.

383
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,209
Get your head
on straight, Ja-eun.

384
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,211
Just focus on getting out
of being the F with me...

385
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,379
I should go.

386
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,008
I shouldn't have
thrown it in her face like that.

387
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:35,724
X goes over here.
X-1/X2 minus 3X+2.

388
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:36,725
Now that?

389
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,060
When the X goes here
what happens to the denominator?

390
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,812
It goes over to 0.

391
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,731
Do you feel sorry for her?

392
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:46,026
-Should we help her out?
-No.

393
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,944
Convergence, 0/0.

394
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,362
How do you do this?

395
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,783
Let's factorize the
number on top first.

396
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:55,744
The first one.
What happens now?

397
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,579
Limit X...

398
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,080
Get your head
on straight, Ja-eun.

399
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:03,084
Just focus on getting out
of being the F with me...

400
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,378
I should go.

401
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,589
Hey!

402
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,365
Why didn't you come to school?
You'll be here tomorrow, right?

403
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,201
I went too far yesterday.
I'm sorry.

404
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,454
Did you become
friends with Su-ji?

405
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:51,633
Don't tell me
school became fun for you.

406
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,469
I think that would

407
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,013
make me sick.

408
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,807
What should I do?

409
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,431
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME TO SCHOOL?

410
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,099
I WENT TOO FAR YESTERDAY.
COME TO SCHOOL, JA-EUN

411
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,022
There will be a special
performance by the ballet club.

412
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,964
Su-ji.

413
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:42,387
Su-ji, go fetch.

414
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,807
A rifle?

415
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,642
My dad's hobby is hunting.

416
00:28:47,725 --> 00:28:50,645
I borrowed it,
thinking I needed it for you.

417
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,565
Su-ji. Seong Su-ji.

418
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,817
Did you think you
could just avoid us?

419
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,318
For how long?

420
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,447
Guess what happens
when hunting dogs

421
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,740
outlive their use?

422
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:09,956
They die.

423
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,791
As if she's going shoot me.

424
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,126
The hell she will.

425
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,712
You guys never leave
evidence behind.

426
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:17,922
And Baek Ha-rin will have a fit.

427
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,675
Da-yeon, you look so awesome.
I'm dying here.

428
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,927
Don't worry.
There won't be any evidence.

429
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,679
This only fires tranquilizers.

430
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,390
Go get the bunny.

431
00:29:59,797 --> 00:30:01,216
Looking for someone?

432
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,095
You don't look too good.

433
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,390
You want some of this at least?
It's only black tea for my diet.

434
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:14,062
Do you know who's
behind this game?

435
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,441
It's obvious, isn't it?

436
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,443
Were you looking for Baek Ha-rin?

437
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,028
I thought...

438
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,821
It's obvious?

439
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:27,200
You mean, everyone knows?

440
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,077
Mom.

441
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,621
I'm sure they do.

442
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,748
As well as the fact that
she's the Director's daughter.

443
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,250
The Director?

444
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,465
Director Choi Ie-hwa
of Baekyeon Group,

445
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,884
one of Korea's top three
conglomerates,

446
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,887
received commendation today
for the contributions made

447
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,014
to the advancement of education.

448
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,600
Baekyeon Group...

449
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,273
She's the granddaughter.

450
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,163
This way, please.

451
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,636
The steak
is nice and tender.

452
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,638
Director Seo, let me ask
you something.

453
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,141
How can you explain this,
medically?

454
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,477
Look. Baekyeon Group
only has one daughter.

455
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,813
Seosim Hospital
only has one daughter.

456
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,481
And us, QB...

457
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:42,942
Daughters only too.

458
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,277
Are you sure this
is a coincidence?

459
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,820
Can this really be a coincidence?

460
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:48,323
Everyone's X chromosome
was just dominant.

461
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,035
By the way, Ha-rin, which
university are you applying to?

462
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,287
If it's okay with you,
how about working

463
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,788
on your portfolio with Do-ah?

464
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:59,000
I think it'll bring
you two closer,

465
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,878
and working together
will make you stronger.

466
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,631
We're already close.

467
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,843
Do-ah is smart and cute.

468
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,013
Cute?

469
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,431
Thanks.

470
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:18,436
Are you still hanging out
with that judo athlete?

471
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:21,189
I'm closer to Ha-rin.

472
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,696
Oh, Dad.

473
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:33,826
Could you support the school's
swim team with more scholarships?

474
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:38,289
A girl named Eun-jeong in our
class has talent but she's poor.

475
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,875
Please don't say no.

476
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,960
Please? Please?

477
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,102
All right, let's do that.

478
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,106
Why don't we have a drink?

479
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,734
All right.

480
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,580
13TH PYRAMID GAME RESULTS

481
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:24,752
I have to throw it out anyway.

482
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,963
It's ten minutes
past the expiration date.

483
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:28,756
It won't kill you.

484
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,432
It won't kill you.

485
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:58,077

DROP-OUT FORM

488
00:34:17,054 --> 00:34:19,056
VIOLENCE ISN'T A JOKE.
IT'S A CRIME

489
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,897
NO MORE SCHOOL VIOLENCE
CALL 117

490
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,566
The game? Our homeroom
teacher probably doesn't know.

491
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,943
If he did, he might want to help.

492
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,613
He knows a lot about
the class dynamics

493
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,990
and everyone's
personal information.

494
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,494
He even cares about kids
like Ja-eun too.

495
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:42,914
Our homeroom teacher...

496
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,962
How many bullying incidents
are solved by teachers?

497
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,464
Maybe one out of ten?

498
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,383
Mr. Im isn't the type that's
close with the students either.

499
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,593
Seong Su-ji.

500
00:34:57,553 --> 00:34:59,055
Nothing's going on, is it?

501
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,307
Ja-eun keeps missing school...

502
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,352
Just let me know
if something's up in class.

503
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,687
You can come to me about
personal issues too.

504
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,356
He does seem to care...

505
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,691
Whether it works or not,
it's worth a try.

506
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,693
I need another plan anyway.

507
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,862
Uh, Mr. Im...

508
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,239
Mr. Im.

509
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,535
The principal is looking for you.

510
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,541
You're going over to
Myeong Ja-eun's house? Right now?

511
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,625
Yes.

512
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,045
She's been skipping school a lot.

513
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:34,048
You work pretty hard.

514
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:36,551
Would he be able to convene an
anti-bullying committee meeting?

515
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:40,179
Even if the person behind it is
the school director's daughter?

516
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,848
Seong Su-ji.

517
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,868
I guarantee

518
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,287
your situation will only get
worse if you try to fight it.

519
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,413
Based on what?

520
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:08,583
Only one person in this class
has ever tried

521
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,544
to stop this game.

522
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,923
Today, we're going to
learn about Spinoza...

523
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,759
Someone in this class
was against this game?

524
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,595
So what?

525
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,681
They've all given up
and going along with it now.

526
00:36:24,265 --> 00:36:26,475
That's your reason, Do-ah?

527
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,645
This means,
that the girl who forced her

528
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,272
to stand down is Ha-rin.

529
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,068
One week before the next game.

530
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,905
Will I be able to get
out of being an F?

531
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,492
You still have a low fever.

532
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:46,621
But I can't let you stay here
for two periods in a row.

533
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,581
Go back to class for now,

534
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,583
and if you keep feeling
unwell, you should go home.

535
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,251
Go back to class?

536
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:54,670
Rest a little
and leave when you're ready.

537
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,776
Your situation will only
get worse if you try to fight it.

538
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:20,112
Will only get worse.

539
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,409
-Hello.
-Hello.

540
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,494
Hi.

541
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:30,164
I don't know what it is
with kids these days.

542
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,291
I tried to break up
what looked like a fight

543
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,709
but they said they were playing.

544
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,253
Is that what they call
"play" these days?

545
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,755
Haha, hoho.

546
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,591
They're really different
from our day.

547
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,677
They're so tough and intense.

548
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,223
I just don't get it.

549
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,101
How can that be joking around?

550
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,358
Wow, big ass.

551
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,777
You think that's playing?

552
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,195
Of course it isn't.

553
00:38:04,281 --> 00:38:06,033
Is your next class PE?

554
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,535
What's so funny?

555
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,412
Are you sure you're
all getting along?

556
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,164
Mr. Im, no nagging on our break.

557
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,916
This is how we always play.

558
00:38:14,291 --> 00:38:15,876
Right, Su-ji?

559
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,255
Oh, Mr. Im.

560
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,383
What's wrong?

561
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,885
Oh, well...

562
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:32,560
Mr. Im, can you take me
to the nurse's office?

563
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,936
I think I'm coming
down with a cold.

564
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:36,522
-I'll go with her.
-No, I'll go with Mr. Im.

565
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,401
Yes, you have class.

566
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,570
Is it okay if I take her?

567
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,447
-Sure.
-Let's go, Su-ji.

568
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,091
You wanted to talk?

569
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,096
Can an anti-bullying
committee meeting

570
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:15,102
be held for our class too?

571
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:18,856
I've been concerned
about you as it is.

572
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,775
Why?

573
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,401
Are the kids bullying you?

574
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,074
Yes.

575
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:33,329
Can you help?

576
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:38,626
There was a student named Wu-ri
in that class last year.

577
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,129
She was bullied, like you.

578
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,801
Ja-eun is going through
the same thing, isn't she?

579
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,434
I might

580
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,895
be able to help you.

581
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,772
Thank God.

582
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,274
Thank God.

583
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,567
Thank you.

584
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,861
I appreciate you telling me.

585
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,364
Su-ji.

586
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,075
Can you tell me again

587
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:15,871
what happened looking
into the camera?

588
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,713
Are you ready?

589
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,008
Did you see Seong Su-ji?

590
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,385
She's doomed.

591
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:30,845
Watch out for Mr. Im.

592
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,847
She must not know
that he's psycho.

593
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,849
-Poor girl.
-I feel sorry for her.

594
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,725
How did she end up as his prey?

595
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,519
She's dumber than I thought.

596
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:40,396
As if he wouldn't know
what's going on.

597
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:42,606
I know. He's money crazy.

598
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,024
Money crazy?

599
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,860
Totally.

600
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:48,696
What if Su-ji ends up
like Cho Wu-ri?

601
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:50,698
No way.

602
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,745
Do you have any bruises
or scrapes?

603
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,873
Huh? No?

604
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:02,042
Having a cigarette burn
would be effective too.

605
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:06,505
In matters like, we need evidence.

606
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,091
But kids these days
are so clever,

607
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,968
they don't leave a mark.

608
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,678
They're still wet
behind their ears

609
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,096
but they've learned
all the tricks.

610
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,598
Hmph.

611
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,566
Damn it.

612
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,902
Damn...

613
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,905
Come on,

614
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,407
you need a burn mark.

615
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,410
Su-ji, if we can get evidence,

616
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:38,787
I'll tell their parents.

617
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:40,915
We can split the
compensation money.

618
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,374
Huh? Look at me.

619
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,792
Clench your jaw. Here we go.

620
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,462
Seong Su-ji! Are you in there?

621
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,504
Seong Su-ji!

622
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,382
Damn, what the hell?

623
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,260
Seong Su-ji!
Are you in there?

624
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:55,346
Su-ji, are you in there?

625
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,555
Hey!

626
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,016
Ow...

627
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,198
Hey!

628
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,533
Su-ji, pull it together.
Let's go!

629
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,124
Seong Su-ji. Myeong Ja-eun.

630
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,835
Hello, Mr. Im.

631
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,089
That way.

632
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,967
Hello.

633
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,469
-Hello.
-Hello.

634
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,475
Are you mental?

635
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,143
Don't you know
what kind of person he is?

636
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,937
What were you doing with him?
He could've really hurt you.

637
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,647
Mr. Im... I mean...

638
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,275
Is he insane?

639
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:56,073
I'm sorry, I should've told you.

640
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,783
I...

641
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,962
The camera is rolling.
Here comes the strip show.

642
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:19,096
What? A strip show?

643
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,181
Who was this?

644
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,435
It was a penalty.

645
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,020
Mr. Im would've told

646
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,688
Da-yeon's parents
about the bullying

647
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,690
and blackmailed them
saying you're the proof.

648
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:31,859
For money.

649
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:34,445
Then Da-yeon would've
gotten back at you.

650
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:39,283
This is what would've happened.
That's Wu-ri.

651
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,286
Cho Wu-ri.

652
00:43:43,287 --> 00:43:46,332
You agreed
to play the game, right?

653
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,208
PYRAMID GAME
SEONG SU-JI

654
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:49,335
THE HIGHEST FORM OF PENALTY

655
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,502
WILL BE APPLIED
IF THE GAME IS DISCLOSED

656
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,713
I AGREE TO THE RULES

657
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:57,217
That's the penalty?
They're all insane.

658
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,928
Did he hit you too?

659
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,597
No.

660
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,474
I don't play the game.

661
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,562
Are you okay?

662
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,607
Wait, he hit you?

663
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,360
Don't worry about it.
These tears are just a reaction.

664
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,572
I'm sorry, Su-ji.

665
00:44:18,655 --> 00:44:19,990
This is my fault.

666
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,911
It's my fault.

667
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:26,580
But it'll be over soon.

668
00:44:26,663 --> 00:44:28,040
What?

669
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,001
How did you know
where to find me though?

670
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,463
Oh...

671
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,883
DROP-OUT FORM

672
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,479
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE

673
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,403
DROP-OUT FORM

674
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,279
Uh...

675
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:03,283
-Ha-rin.
-Please tell Mr. Im

676
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:06,120
to just shut up and teach

677
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:09,123
as if he's barely there.

678
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,460
Do you understand?

679
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,337
Yes.

680
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:23,387
He's done
this before but he wasn't fired?

681
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,097
I know this is a private school,

682
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,307
but that means
he has connections.

683
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,435
Someone related to Baek Ha-rin.

684
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,187
We should've held on to his phone.

685
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,397
It's proof.

686
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,648
Huh?

687
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,652
Oh, I didn't think about that.

688
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:41,447
Oh, well.

689
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,784
But thanks. I can start
thinking straight again.

690
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:49,538
By the way, were you
ever friends with Go Eun-byeol?

691
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:51,832
No.

692
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:53,167
She told me the two of you joined

693
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:54,793
the class when
you became juniors.

694
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,546
I did. Me and...

695
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:02,176
It wasn't Eun-byeol.

696
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,596
What was that nutjob
trying to do then?

697
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:18,484
Ja-eun,
I have a favor to ask.

698
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:22,029
Please, play the game.

699
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,781
I really want to escape
from being an F with you.

700
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,538
I mean it.

701
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:51,850
I'm sorry.
It'll be over soon.

702
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,602
Once I drop out.

703
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,437
-You're dropping out?
-Yes.

704
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,397
If I'm not here,

705
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,942
the situation for you
will change too.

706
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,193
This game

707
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,238
will never end,
just because you're gone.

708
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:07,282
This has been going on
because Baek Ha-rin isn't alone.

709
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,034
The rest are all the same.

710
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:11,161
Being a monster rubs off.

711
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:12,955
You saw for yourself.

712
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,257
You're crazy. Piss off!
I'm no doormat!

713
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,300
We need evidence...

714
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:29,763
Someone has to stop it
for this to truly end.

715
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,057
This class has to change.

716
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,270
No, let me rephrase that.

717
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,439
Let's destroy the Pyramid Game.

718
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,316
That's the only answer.

719
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:43,110
Right?

720
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,959
Hey.

721
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,211
Don't you know how
to greet a teacher?

722
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:05,340
-Hello.
-Good.

723
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,467
But you're not a teacher.

724
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:09,511
You're parasite in this class.

725
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:13,640
That's how kids talk these days.

726
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:15,892
What?

727
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,729
Why you...

728
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,369
Damn...

729
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:37,873
Hello.

730
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,833
-Hi.
-Hello.

731
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,460
Good morning.

732
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:45,088
I'm going to call roll. Sit down.

733
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,386
Seong Su-ji, hurry up and sit.

734
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,515
Who's late? Myeong Ja-eun?

735
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,852
She's always late.

736
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:01,730
You know what tomorrow is, right?
The last Thursday of the month.

737
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,399
Be there.

738
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,027
Blue wind,
mark it with a star.

739
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,613
Blue is sight.

740
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:10,864
Wind is touch.

741
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,533
What does it mean?
Your senses...

742
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:16,370
That's all for today.

743
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,913
Thank you.

744
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,883
Ji-ae.

745
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:32,969
Can you stop being so noisy
when you eat?

746
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:35,597
Huh?

747
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,600
Oh, sorry.

748
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,593
ONE HOUR BEFORE
THE PYRAMID GAME

749
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,894
Ja-eun, you're
really not coming...

750
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,646
Ah...

751
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,823
Who are you voting for today?

752
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,951
If you don't have anyone
to vote for, vote for me.

753
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,786
I want to be an A too.

754
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,830
Yeah, vote for one of us.

755
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,124
-Let's just go.
-Hmph.

756
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,883

00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,608
Let's start H.R.

759
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,026
Take your seats.

760
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,590
-You're going to play?
-Yes.

761
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:36,676
Then sit.

762
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,814
I thought you were ghosting me.

763
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,816
I had a lot to think about.

764
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,193
You're right.

765
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,197
This game can't go on.

766
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:06,206
Did you get the text?
The link for the app.

767
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,223
You know the rules
so I'll skip the explanation.

768
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:29,062
Then cast your votes
for the 14th Pyramid Game.

769

773
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,505
According to the rules,
the F has to have zero votes.

774
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,965
If you and I vote for each other

775
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,634
you, me, Pyo Ji-ae, Joo Seung-ie
will all have one vote.

776
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,386
That makes us all Ds.

777
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,222
We'll be ranked last
but at least we won't be Fs.

778
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,765
That's the loophole in this game.

779
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:07,851
None of us will be Fs.

780
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:11,021
This game isn't perfect.

781
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,231
That's where we start.
