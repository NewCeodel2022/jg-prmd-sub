subtitles for the platform @mkdoramas

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,754
Because you were the only girl
who opposed to this game.

3
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:06,715
Right?

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:08,842
This is my plan.

5
00:00:09,426 --> 00:00:12,053
The pyramid?
Fuck it.

6
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,765
Me, become the F?

7
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:19,477
Interesting idea.
I'll think about it.

8
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:21,896
What? Did you expect me
to say yes right away?

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:23,940
I may loathe Ha-rin,

10
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,025
but you're threatening me
just like her.

11
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:28,111
I can't take a gamble
and go all-in with you.

12
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:29,571
Don't you think?

13
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,873
I can't take it anymore, Su-ji.

14
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,624
Do I have to die for you to stop?

15
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,042
Then, I will.

16
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,628
Please, stop this.

17
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,131
Thanks for everything, guys.

18
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,867
Joo Seung-ie,
come out of there!

19
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,038
Oh no.

20
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:42,811
Oh no.

21
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,187
Are you okay?

22
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,858
Why did you do it?

23
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,985
You're still bleeding.

24
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,369
Seong Su-ji...

25
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,188
Why did you do it, Su-ji?

26
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,983
You made a mistake this time.

27
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,068
A mistake?

28
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:35,905
If you turn down my offer,
everyone will know your secret.

29
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,950
You don't want that, do you?

30
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,997
You're the worst.
Are you crazy?

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,748
What the hell?

32
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,042
-What did you do to Seung-ie?
-Yeah, what did you do?

33
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,419
Say something!

34
00:02:49,502 --> 00:02:51,004
Are you deaf?

35
00:02:51,087 --> 00:02:52,088
She's crazy.

36
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,256
So shameless.

37
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:57,093
I believe she's independent,
and conducts herself well.

38
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,263
You have no idea
what's happening at school,

39
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,265
but you simply believe

40
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:04,851
that everything is okay
with your child?

41
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,272
There is bullying going on
in this class.

42
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,733
Ms. Yun!

43
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,153
Bullying?

44
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:19,449
I believe your
daughter is a victim.

45
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,204
What do you think
you're doing?

46
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,789
You need to leave.

47
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,958
I'm sorry, sir.

48
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,169
I'm Im Ju-hyeong,
the homeroom teacher.

49
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:34,172
-You can talk with me.
-Tell me again.

50
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,633
Bullying?

51
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,551
If you don't believe me,

52
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:42,096
why don't you check for yourself?

53
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,434
Su-ji, no excuses?

54
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,478
Why aren't you saying anything?

55
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,772
What did you do to Seung-ie?

56
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,232
She's so shameless.

57
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,486
A mistake...

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,411
I don't know.

59
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,122
It looks totally different.

60
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,540
She's putting on a show.

61
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,833
But why?

62
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,210
Why is she putting on this act?

63
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,544
You threatened
the girls, didn't you?

64
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,673
Threats and manipulation
is Ha-rin's specialty.

65
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,050
Besides, your threats are sticks,

66
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:23,346
but Ha-rin's are
threats and carrots.

67
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,766
You're just a lower
version of Ha-rin.

68
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,643
Then, Ha-rin

69
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:31,521
can get something on you
and raise your rank?

70
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,564
Raise your rank?

71
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,067
Seung-ie's too?

72
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,194
You have a point.

73
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,654
That was my mistake.

74
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,739
And you used it
to your advantage.

75
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:42,907
What am I going to do, Ha-rin?

76
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,701
If anyone finds out...

77
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,329
What was your rank again?

78
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,135
I told you you'd find
out soon enough.

79
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:04,929
You were wrong.

80
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,184
Her act makes me sick.

81
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,361
You're a pyscho, aren't you?

82
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,240
There is more yet to come.

83
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,367
Su-ji.

EPISODE 5

90
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,969
What's going on?

91
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,221
You...

92
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,307
-Is she okay?
-Is she okay?

93
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,475
-Is she okay?
-Girls!

94
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,644
Were you fooling around again?

95
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,979
There's no need
to be surprised...

96
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,648
The girls are always...

97
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:40,066
Mr. Im,

98
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,403
my daughter has been talking
about a new girl making trouble.

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,324
Is she a bully then?

100
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:50,409
How can there be
a bully in this class?

101
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,120
I want an explanation.

102
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,330
Su-ji.

103
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,874
It's nothing.

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,670
Su-ji is still new to this class

105
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,339
and this was just a
misunderstanding between friends.

106
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,757
So...

107
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,511
I think it's best
if you let us handle it.

108
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:12,348
Right, Mom?

109
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:19,939
Kids have their own
way of doing things.

110
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,192
Don't you agree, Mr. Seo?

111
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,713
C rank Su-ji
harassed D rank Seung-ie,

112
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,215
which led to her suicide attempt.

113
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,386
Only As or those with an A's
permission can mess with Fs.

114
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,597
That's our rule.

115
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,600
Su-ji is not an A

116
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,518
and Seung-ie is not an F.

117
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,689
So this is a disciplinary
committee of sorts.

118
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,238
Then, should we decide
on the penalty first?

119
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:12,325
Any ideas?

120
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,411
How about we confiscate
Su-ji's votes tomorrow?

121
00:08:15,494 --> 00:08:17,246
All five.

122
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,415
In the 15th Pyramid Game,

123
00:08:19,498 --> 00:08:22,043
-you're not allowed to vote.
-You're not allowed to vote.

124
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,675
What's going to happen to us?

125
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,386
Then the D's alliance...

126
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,181
It's over.

127
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:37,016
If Su-ji can't vote,

128
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:39,352
our plan is doomed.

129
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,402
I have to do something
whether it works or not.

130
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:52,615
Hang on. Before that, Seung-ie,
did I harass you?

131
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,824
How?

132
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,117
What?

133
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,622
You blackmailed me.

134
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,123
I blackmailed you? With what?

135
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,543
Do you have any reason
to be blackmailed?

136
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,172
Don't try to get out of this.

137
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,425
The fact is, Seung-ie tried to
kill herself because of you.

138
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,635
I don't know...

139
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,721
I have no memory of harassing
or blackmailing her.

140
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,474
Do you have any proof that I did?
I just don't get it.

141
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,269
You really are shameless.
She almost died because of you.

142
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,146
Then what about all the girls
who wanted to die because of you?

143
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,025
How about we vote on it?

144
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,864
This class belongs
to all 25 of us,

145
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,492
and we're all in
this game together.

146
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:39,203
You have it all wrong.

147
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,248
I'm not the one who judges you.
The game does.

148
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:45,459
This was what you meant?

149
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:48,254
I gave you a hint, didn't I?

150
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:54,385
They must be deciding
by majority.

151
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:55,553
How very democratic.

152
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,721
As expected.

153
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,514
Looks to me that our kids

154
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,558
are solving problems

155
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,519
in a wholesome and sensible way.

156
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,522
A way that's non-violent.

157
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,317
That looks non-violent to you?

158
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,945
I think it looks
like a public execution.

159
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,822
Ms. Yun.

160
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:19,035
How can we as adults
just look on and do nothing?

161
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,044
If you open that door,

162
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,714
I'll deal with that girl myself.

163
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,556
21 votes.

164
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,060
Su-ji has lost the right to vote
in the next game.

165
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,229
She only lost
the right to vote then?

166
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,023
Does that mean she can still
receive votes?

167
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,566
I'm confused.

168
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,444
This penalty doesn't
automatically make her a F.

169
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,238
She can't vote herself
but she can still receive votes.

170
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,324
Any more questions?

171
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,660
We're screwed.

172
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,704
But Ha-rin...

173
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,999
I'm not done yet.

174
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,419
Have you completely
lost your mind, Ms. Yun?

175
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,880
You're only a temp here!
You had no right!

176
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,590
Please watch your language.

177
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,884
I believe that the
school has aided

178
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,261
and abetted the
problems in that class.

179
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:20,971
From the students
to the location...

180
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,308
Stop!
Stop talking!

181
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,603
Do you not want to
renew your contract?

182
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,109
It's all over, right?

183
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:34,610
I'm blocking your number.

184
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,945
You better not
try to blackmail me again.

185
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,738
I'll do what Seung-ie did.

186
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,532
Crazy bitch.

187
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,242
Ja-eun.

188
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,451
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,453
Huh? For what?

190
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,872
For thinking you were wrong.

191
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,588
Anyway,

192
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:58,134
we all agree that Ha-rin
put her up to this, right?

193
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,514
Looks like only you agree.

194
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,643
Ha-rin knew exactly
what my plan was

195
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,687
and who I'd approach.

196
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,440
I guess it's not
entirely impossible, but...

197
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,650
I feel like there's
something more...

198
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,652
Your dad...

199
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:19,238
You said he wouldn't be coming.

200
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,657
Ha-rin was behind that too.

201
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,662
WRITER: WILLIAM GOLDING
THE PYRAMID

202
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,705
PRESENTER BAEK HA-RIN
TEACHER IN CHARGE YUN NA-HEE

203
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,582
TEACHER IN CHARGE IM JU-HYEONG

204
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:34,378
Why don't we all play a game?

205
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,052
The book we'll be
looking at today

206
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:46,390
is "The Pyramid," a novel
about England's class society.

207
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,559
Since our parents are here today,

208
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,353
I'd like to ask all
of you to join in.

209
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:58,486
Use this code
to activate the app.

210
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,864
The adults are playing this game?

211
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,657
Just so you know,
this app is for single-use only

212
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,202
and access will be blocked
automatically in an hour.

213
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,370
Thanks, Ye-won.

214
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:15,920
What are you up to, Ha-rin?

215
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,051
Basically

216
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,512
this is a popularity vote game.

217
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,808
You just have to vote for
five girls out of the 25.

218
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:33,062
You can read the details
up here.

219
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,772
Based on the number
of votes you get,

220
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,650
you are ranked from A to F.

221
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:38,817
Ha-rin.

222
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,487
This doesn't seem
like a very good idea.

223
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,744
Ha-rin,

224
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,163
why don't you continue
your presentation

225
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,666
in the next literature class?

226
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,586
I'm sorry about this.
I'm not the literature teacher

227
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,297
so I didn't know what this class
would be about.

228
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,681
Mother.

229
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,477
What are you doing here?

230
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:14,645
It's the Chairman.

231
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,771
Isn't that the Chairman?

232
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,565
Of Baekyeon Group.

233
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,581
I'll continue.

234
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,165
Fs

235
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,626
are the lowest rank.

236
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,879
The lowest class,
if we're going by the book.

237
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,633
But...

238
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,470
Why play a game like this?

239
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,306
-Mom!
-What?

240
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,932
Did I say something wrong?

241
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,977
If it's what my granddaughter
wants, we should all play.

242
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,985
Ha-rin must have
a good reason.

243
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:07,990
Why don't you be a good sport
and play along?

244
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,700
Madam Chairman,

245
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,495
would you like my help
downloading the app?

246
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,172

Seong Su-ji.

255
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,894
Mr. Seong, what do you think?

256
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,562
If one's class was determined

257
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,232
like a pyramid
with a popularity vote

258
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,983
and Su-ji is an F?

259
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,745
Class exists everywhere.

260
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,373
In the military, out in society,
and also...

261
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,417
In school.

262
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,920
When you become adults,
you'll see that

263
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:47,131
school is a smaller
version of society.

264
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,007
And that in society,

265
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,052
class can lead to law
and order, and that you...

266
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,513
-What is he saying?
-What a boomer.

267
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:55,848
That's what she had to
put up with growing up?

268
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,850
-That's her dad.
-I know.

269
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,978
Order?

270
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:04,940
Even if it makes
an F want to die,

271
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,945
would you still say that?
That's just order?

272
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,450
-What do you mean?
-I'm saying

273
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,827
that it could be hell
for someone.

274
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,163
For example...

275
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,956
Someone, who?

276
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,132
Anyway, a game is a game
and this is the result.

277
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,343
The As and F have been decided.

278
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,970
That's a fact.

279
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,139
Right, sir?

280
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,976
Uh, right.

281
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,103
That's what your dad says.

282
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,690
Su-ji, what are you going to do?

283
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,818
This is your little preview?

284
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,488
Because you made Seung-ie
hurt herself,

285
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,989
I've become public
enemy number one

286
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,699
and could go back
to an F at any time.

287
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,076
This is your warning?

288
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,911
And if I don't want
that to happen

289
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,078
I should do exactly
as you say?

290
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,664
This is your plan?

291
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,957
Then...

292
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,670
I'll make the pyramid
come crashing down.

293
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,028
You have a spirited daughter.

294
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,406
Send her to Baekyeon Group
when the time comes.

295
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:40,077
I'm the Chairman.

296
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,101
Behave yourself.

297
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,352
I believe in you.

298
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,648
Why did you come today?

299
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,942
You never do.

300
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,085
I should've invited my parents

301
00:19:30,168 --> 00:19:31,879
if I knew your
grandma would be here.

302
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,255
By the way...

303
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,758
I heard you recommended Yu-rim
for the Baekyeon Art scholarship.

304
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,428
I'm feeling a little hurt.

305
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,263
I saw you and Da-yeon
sharing looks earlier too.

306
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,890
You don't tell me
anything anymore.

307
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,433
I'm totally disappointed.

308
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,477
Wu-ie.

309
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,688
-Aren't you going home?
-Can you give me a ride?

310
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,856
If you drop me off
in front of my house...

311
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:52,065
Bye.

312
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,575
Su-ji was going to
get the Ds together.

313
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:02,993
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE,
TOMORROW AT LUNCH...

314
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,746
Yoon Ye-won, Joo Seung-ie,
Ra Hae-jun.

315
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,958
I wonder who gave her the idea?

316
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,835
Who knows?

317
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,129
Hmm.

318
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,882
Do-ah, you used to be so cute.

319
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,152
CLASS MOTTO HAPPINESS
FOR EVERYONE, A CLASS FOR ALL

320
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,165
It was a brilliant idea.

321
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,209
Although, the method you used
was exactly like Ha-rin's.

322
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,295
If I had refused your offer,

323
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:58,298
would I have been in trouble
because of your threat?

324
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,178
No.

325
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,930
I never threatened you.

326
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,015
You just took it that way.

327
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,017
And I just used how you felt.

328
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,020
I really don't care about your
friendship or whatever it is,

329
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,563
but tell Eun-jeong to be careful

330
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,190
if she doesn't want
everyone to know.

331
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,109
Does that mean you have
no intention of telling anyone?

332
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,235
Why?

333
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,404
What's more interesting than
other people's private lives?

334
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,699
It doesn't matter compared to
the fact that Ha-rin is a psycho.

335
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,744
Do you mean that?

336
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,540
I'm not like Ha-rin.

337
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,136
It's okay, it's okay.

338
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,221
The three of us
will vote for you.

339
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,140
We just have to avoid
being Fs, don't we?

340
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,308
On that note, Su-ji will buy.

341
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,977
Buy, buy, buy.

342
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,311
Cup tteokbokki,
and a hot bar too.

343
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,814
Also, roasted eggs.

344
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,275
21 votes.

345
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,653
Su-ji has lost her right to
vote in the next game.

346
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,448
What's with that look
of distrust on your face?

347
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:08,326
Ja-eun, she keeps doubting me.

348
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,203
Punch her for me. Make it hurt.

349
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,580
Uh...

350
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,248
I'm gonna go.

351
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,208
My stomach hurts.

352
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:18,920
Doesn't
seem like number two.

353
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:20,213
Maybe it's just nerves?

354
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,308
Th-thank you.

355
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,977
-It's past the best-by date.
-Not today.

356
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,104
Hey.

357
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,939
You know the part-timer?

358
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,609
Hang on a sec.

359
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,611
Isn't that Cho Wu-ri's brother?

360
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,113
How did you know right away?

361
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:47,115
You didn't?

362
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,285
Cup tteokbokki,
a hot bar, and an egg?

363
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,037
Yes, and a chocolate milk.

364
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,333
Ow.

365
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:57,459
What are you doing?

366
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,627
Huh?

367
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,129
Her bodyguard?

368
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,547
What was that about?

369
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,096
It's all your fault.

370
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:13,892
What did I ever do to you?

371
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,228
What did I do?

372
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,020
2-5 CHO WU-RI

373
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,778
What did you all
do to my sister?

374
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,619
So the alliance
of Ds is a failure?

375
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,371
What about the camera above
the blackboard?

376
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,956
Oh...

377
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,501
That's okay.

378
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,795
Not that we have
any solid evidence yet.

379
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,214
C-camera?

380
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,216
It's plan B.

381
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:29,843
I'm gonna get the word out
about this game.

382
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,554
No, what if they do to you
what they did to Wu-ri?

383
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,557
We can't

384
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,809
let that happen.

385
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,687
You and I may be able to take it,

386
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,439
but Ji-ae is going to break soon.

387
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,065
She's going to get
seriously hurt.

388
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:45,734
Ji-ae...

389
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,360
We need to get
more people on our side.

390
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,904
Not with threats like last time,

391
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,697
but like how you
persuaded Jae-hyeong.

392
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,574
We can't be like Ha-rin.

393
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,367
We have to be more like you.

394
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,593
What are you doing here?

395
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,053
Oh, well...

396
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,514
I was wondering if you
were feeling better.

397
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,561
I bought this at the pharmacy
on my way here.

398
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,193
Wanna sit?

399
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,744
Oh, uh...

400
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:41,539
I haven't been
on a swing in ages...

401
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,167
I'm okay.

402
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,179
Su-ji isn't a cold person.

403
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,640
She's just really objective.

404
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:03,895
That's why she can see the pros
and cons of people as they are.

405
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,314
What I'm trying to say is

406
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,525
don't get the wrong
idea about her.

407
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:13,154
She's on our side.

408
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,003
Su-ji has lost the right
to vote in the next game.

409
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,713
We need to get
more people on our side.

410
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,423
Not with threats like last time,

411
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,383
but like how you
persuaded Jae-hyeong.

412
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,219
We can't be like Ha-rin.
We have to be more like you.

413
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:37,345
PYRAMID GAME
NOTICE

414
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,680
SEONG SU-JI IS NOT ALLOWED
TO VOTE IN THE 15TH GAME

415
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,519
-Thanks.
-Bye.

416
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,482
Aren't you going home?

417
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,527
I'm not in the mood
to walk all the way home.

418
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:54,612
I could make you run home
in less than a minute.

419
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,080
The truck stops
at the Bongpo store next.

420
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,248
You'll be able to
get your bag back

421
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:06,541
if you can make
it there in 5 minutes.

422
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,712
Where are you going?

423
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:12,380
The police station.

424
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,716
The police station is right
next to the Bongpo store.

425
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:18,219
Psychos are everywhere.

426
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,388
Darn it!

427
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,730
JOO SEUNG-IE
NEW MESSAGE

428
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:36,112
Make Ja-eun
the F at tomorrow's game.

429
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:39,157
MAKE JA-EUN THE F
AT TOMORROW'S GAME

430
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,646
-Got it?
-Yes.

431
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,814
See you.

432
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:11,981
Bye.

433
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,863
Walking is easier after a run.

434
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,865
Go home, it's late.

435
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,409
I think...

436
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,786
I know what to do.

437
00:28:35,797 --> 00:28:37,799
CHANGE IN CLASS SCHEDULE
2ND PERIOD MATH 4TH PERIOD PE

438
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,105
I'm not like Ha-rin.

439
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,565
See you tomorrow.

440
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,817
Do you really have a way

441
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,735
to bring the pyramid down?

442
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,701
You know how adults played
the game on Parents' Day?

443
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,829
Strictly speaking,
you disclosed our game.

444
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:10,957
Don't you think so, guys?

445
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,171
Hmm?

446
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,633
We have to break Ha-rin's image
of being an untouchable A.

447
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,051
Don't worry.

448
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:24,679
She can't come after you
over some pushback like this.

449
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,098
She knows very well

450
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,683
that you have a lot of pull
in this class.

451
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,061
All you have to do is this.

452
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,400
What do you think you're doing?

453
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:38,902
Why are you overreacting?

454
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,616
Well...

455
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,785
What do the rest of you think?

456
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,913
Who thinks I disclosed the game?

457
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,456
Anyone?

458
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,833
Did your parents suspect?

459
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,714
I guess not, Ye-rim.

460
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:00,882
Come on.

461
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,550
Who's gonna answer
if you ask them straight out?

462
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,219
They'd be too
scared to say a thing.

463
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,179
Let's do a secret ballot.

464
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,347
Agreed?

465
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,724
It'll be 100% secret, right?

466
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,601
Then, I'm in.

467
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,437
Yeon-du, what about you?

468
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:16,940
If Ye-rim wants to,
then I'm in.

469
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,650
Does this mean we're skipping
the morning study period?

470
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:20,401
Yes!

471
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,237
Hey, enough.

472
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,781
Yeah, stop it, Ye-rim.

473
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,619
I just think if Su-ji lost
her votes for breaking the rules,

474
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,454
then the same
rule should be applied

475
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,039
to Ha-rin since that's only fair.

476
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,749
Even if she is an A.

477
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,919
Like you said,
we're all in this game together.

478
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,755
Like you said,
we're all in this game together.

479
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,384
Penalties should be the same
too if you broke the rules.

480
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,602
You're right.
We're all in this game together.

481
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,272
What's going on?

482
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,899
This never happened before...

483
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,570
IN FAVOR 13 VOTES,
AGAINST 11 VOTES

484
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,155
-No way.
-Is this for real?

485
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,289
-You agreed?
-Yes.

486
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,671
Then what comes next?

487
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,716
Forget that I asked you
to become the F.

488
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,426
I want you to become
an A in this round.

489
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,136
With Ja-eun, Ji-ae,
and Jae-hyeong's

490
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:29,345
votes you can become an A.

491
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,974
If anyone can be Ha-rin's equal
and bring the girls together,

492
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,184
it's you, the idol of class five.

493
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,190
Ha-rin...

494
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:51,784
PYRAMID GAME / NOTICE /
SEONG SU-JI, BAEK HA-RIN ARE

495
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,910
NOT ALLOWED TO VOTE
IN THE 15TH GAME

496
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,333
Get set.

497
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,252
Get set.

498
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,838
Vote for Ye-rim later.
Don't vote for me.

499
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,757
I've already told
Ji-ae and Jae-hyeong.

500
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,759
-What? Why?
-Okay, look straight ahead.

501
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,886
I came up with a different way.

502
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,807
I already ran once.

503
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,006
STUDY PERIOD

504
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,801
What the...? What's this?

505
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,595
Ye-rim.

506
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,722
Isn't this about you?

507
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,935
DAUGHTER OF OO FOUNDATION
SUSPECTED OF BRIBING AGENCY...

508
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,729
What's going on?

509
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,940
DAUGHTER OF OO FOUNDATION
SUSPECTED OF BRIBING AGENCY...

510
00:33:07,276 --> 00:33:09,862
CONGLOMERATE BUILDS GYM
FOR DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL?

511
00:33:09,987 --> 00:33:11,739
Oh no.

512
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,575
I know how you hate
this kind of stuff.

513
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,870
Who was it?

514
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,708
Only our class
knew about the gym.

515
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,585
Who was it? Damn it!

516
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,089
I'm Im Ye-rim's classmate.

517
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,216
She's always bragging about
her rich family...

518
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,281
Who was it?

519
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:54,949
Come clean, now.

520
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:57,452
Ye-rim's prince is angry.

521
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,788
If that's what friendship looks
like, I don't have any friends.

522
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,956
Don't you think?

523
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,124
Huh?

524
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,375
Ji-young, was it you?

525
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,585
Just kidding.

526
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,295
But you have a big mouth.

527
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,506
Eun-jeong!

528
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,314
Damn you,
Shim Eun-jeong, you crazy...

529
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,400
Have you lost it? Stop.

530
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,655
Don't, stop it.

531
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,074
Stop it!

532
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,287
What are you doing?

533
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,331
Stop hitting her.

534
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,416
You've changed, Ja-eun.

535
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,335
Makes me want to break you.

536
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,170
Get out of my way.

537
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,547
Get out of my way!

538
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,342
Don't you think
there's something strange

539
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,094
about Ye-rim's photo?

540
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,888
Looks like it was
taken in this class.

541
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,182
With a hidden camera.

542
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,152
A hidden camera?

543
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,371
Where the hell is it?

544
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,210
Stop it.

545
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,670
I said, stop it!

546
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,880
You were caught
on a hidden camera!

547
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,719
This photo...

548
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:42,515
THE TRUTH BEHIND "L"
GIRL GROUP TRAINEE...

549
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,893
SHE HASN'T EVEN DEBUTED BUT
HER AGENCY REACHED OUT.

550
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,186
GETTING SUED FOR
TELLING THE TRUTH...

551
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,897
ANTI-FAN ACCOUNT
FOR TRAINEE "L"

552
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,072
This account
belongs to Joo Seung-ie.

553
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,949
Even if I say

554
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:04,036
Seung-ie is a troll,
no one will believe me.

555
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:07,498
Has that been

556
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,793
always there?

557
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,978
Apologize to Ji-young first.

558
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,190
If you ever treat
my friends like that again,

559
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,067
I'll never forgive you.

560
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,071
Apologize.

561
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,282
Or I won't ever see you again.

562
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,044
I'm sorry.

563
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,963
But if it really was Ji-young...

564
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,966
There should be
an SD card inside the camera.

565
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:01,844
We'll be able to know
who put it there.

566
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:06,098
And who broke
the rules this time.

567
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:09,185
What was our rule, Do-ah?

568
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:20,821
"The highest form of penalty
will be applied

569
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,157
if the game is disclosed."

570
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:40,174
That's mine.

571
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,011
Yours?

572
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,179
This camera?

573
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,305
Yes.

574
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,390
OMG.

575
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,892
I know something
is going on in this class,

576
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,228
and I wanted to know what it was.

577
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,190
I don't believe you.

578
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,862
OMG.

579
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,407
Believe it. It was me.

580
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,255
She installed a camera
to find evidence of bullying?

581
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,798
Who'd believe that?

582
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,383
What was she thinking?

583
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,719
Won't this end her
career as a teacher?

584
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,888
Installing a camera
crossed the line.

585
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,348
It was way over the line.

586
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:30,891
Totally.

587
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,610
You're honestly going to say

588
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,320
you know nothing
about what's going on?

589
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:48,409
The end of my career?
You're right, it is.

590
00:38:49,326 --> 00:38:51,078
I'm too embarrassed
to be teacher anymore!

591
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,292
Oh my.

592
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,878
How scary.

593
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,254
Let's get back to work.

594
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:01,589
Keep it up.

595
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,425
Hey.

596
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,267
FINAL EXAM QUESTIONS

597
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,270
Literature was a shocker,

598
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,065
but Ye-rim and Eun-jeong
shocked me too.

599
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,484
"You were caught
on a hidden camera!"

600
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,860
It was so obvious, right?

601
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,446
100 percent.
I'm not sure about Ye-rim.

602
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,031
She is, for sure.

603
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:28,157
I just got the chills.

604
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,784
-Doesn't it put you off?
-Yeah.

605
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,535
Are you going to
vote for Eun-jeong later?

606
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,287
I don't know.

607
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,705
Should we vote for her or not?

608
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,637
That camera
wasn't Literature's, was it?

609
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,097
It belonged to Su-ji, right?

610
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,932
Guess her plan failed
since it was discovered.

611
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,266
Oops, sorry.

612
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:56,185
Did I just hit where it hurts?
Haha.

613
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,980
But did you three
know about the camera?

614
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,988
Where is Su-ji anyhow?

615
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,836
I'm sorry I couldn't
help after all.

616
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:25,131
If you're here about the
anti-bullying committee again,

617
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,508
then bring me evidence first.

618
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:36,684
This was written up
in July two years ago.

619
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:39,353
How could students
be assigned to a class

620
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,857
even before they enrolled
in this school?

621
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,192
Is this the kind of influence
Baek Ha-rin has?

622
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,363
Watch what you say, Ms. Yun.

623
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:52,283
What do you take this school for?

624
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,784
I've been hearing rumors

625
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,537
about how often she
comes to your office.

626
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,331
If you keep refusing
to answer my questions,

627
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,876
I'll have to report you
to the Office of Education.

628
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:09,508
Ms. Yun,
the director wants to see you.

629
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,267
You asked to see me...

630
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,316
It was you

631
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,401
who asked me to come?

632
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,491
This school belongs to
Baekyeon Foundation, doesn't it?

633
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,535
I have a question.

634
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,120
Would you like to sit?

635
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,164
Or you can just stand there
as you listen.

636
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,582
Baek Ha-rin.

637
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,963
What's important to you?

638
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:49,340
Money?

639
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,507
Your job?

640
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:51,717
Family?

641
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,470
Honor in society?

642
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,682
Usually, those are
what move adults.

643
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,268
Is this a threat?

644
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,438
Your literature class is boring.

645
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,440
You should study more.

646
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,319
Just focus on your classes.

647
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,447
Don't you want
to keep working here?

648
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:24,166
I'm so embarrassed, as an adult.

649
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,797
I didn't expect an adult
to say that.

650
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,425
I know.

651
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,557
But you know, the camera
was going too far.

652
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,479
What's your plan?

653
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,856
I'm thinking about it.

654
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,240
I may be an embarrassing adult,

655
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,951
but if you ever need help
even from someone like me,

656
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,623
give me a call anytime.

657
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,680
Thank you.

658
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,851
Su-ji!

659
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,062
Don't back down.

660
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,149
You girls don't have to.

661
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,569
To you, Baek Ha-rin

662
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,489
is just another
girl in your class.

663
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,723
Should we report Literature?

664
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,684
Or we can tell the principal so
that she never teaches again...

665
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,394
You're so dumb.

666
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:11,815
Is that why you
let your dad beat you up?

667
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,487
Oh, wait.

668
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,739
Your brother died because of you.

669
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,366
While in your mother's womb.

670
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,743
Is that when it all started?

671
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,162
The others will laugh
if they ever find out

672
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,748
that at home, you're an F.

673
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,465
That's a mean
thing to say, Ha-rin.

674
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,634
Yeah? So?

675
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:52,106
Ha-rin knew about it.

676
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,608
Looks like it was
taken in this class.

677
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,444
With a hidden camera.

678
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,614
Only Ja-eun and I

679
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,242
knew about the
camera in the classroom.

680
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,540
What's going on?

681
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:11,375
Fifth period will
be starting soon.

682
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:13,752
You told her about the camera,
didn't you?

683
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,630
To Ji-ae.

684
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:18,215
It was you, wasn't it?

685
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,592
You told Ha-rin.

686
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,636
What?

687
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,513
Why would she?

688
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,432
When Ha-rin brought up
the hidden camera,

689
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,641
only you and Seung-ie
didn't look surprised.

690
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:29,810
Don't you think
there's something strange

691
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,437
about Ye-rim's photo?

692
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,605
Looks like it was
taken in this class.

693
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,691
With a hidden camera.

694
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,193
You could only react that way
if you knew the camera was there,

695
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:42,698
and that
Baek Ha-rin knew about it.

696
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,454
Is this true?

697
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:51,623
Why?

698
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,668
Why did you do it?

699
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,466
Can you really trust her?

700
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,633
Of course.

701
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,720
Why wouldn't we?
If the Ds form an alliance,

702
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,638
our rank will go up...

703
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,851
Are you okay?

704
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:14,605
Raise your rank?

705
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:16,023
Seung-ie's too?

706
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,942
There's a camera
in the classroom.

707
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,862
Su-ji thinks you won't be able to

708
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,655
take it any longer.

709
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,283
Ji-ae.

710
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,250
No. I don't even want to know.

711
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,919
I don't want to hear it.

712
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:41,715
Leave.

713
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,217
And don't

714
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,386
ever come back here again.

715
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,811
I'm sorry.

716
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,730
I'm sorry.

717
00:46:57,856 --> 00:46:59,358
I'm sorry...

718
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:01,652
I'm sorry.

719
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,223
I'm here.

720
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,016
-Hey.
-Hi.

721
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:35,102
If I'm right, you and Ja-eun...

722
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,270
-Is that good?
-Yes.

723
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,437
-Can I have a bite?
-Uh-huh.

724
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,772
Are you listening?

725
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,107
What did you get?

726
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:44,903
Anyway...

727
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,615
Su-ji, you're such a klutz!

728
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:49,783
Me?

729
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:51,410
Don't fight. I'll clean it up.

730
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,178
Ha...

731
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,973
Nothing has changed.

732
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:15,976
It has.

733
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,644
At least you have.

734
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,066
As for Ji-ae...

735
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,860
I know.

736
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,820
She just couldn't trust us.

737
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,616
I don't think that's why.

738
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,036
She was friends with
Seung-ie for longer,

739
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,954
and had a moment of weakness.

740
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,792
You and I are so different.

741
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,922
Well, I'm not as strong as you.

742
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,925
When you asked me
not to vote for you in PE...

743
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:52,012
Your plan was to become the F
and get it all on camera, right?

744
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,681
How did you know?

745
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:59,019
I've hung out with you long
enough to figure things out.

746
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,021
I would never have
been able to do that.

747
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,898
I'd be too scared.

748
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,027
Now that the camera is gone,

749
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:09,029
you don't have to go through
with that, right?

750
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:12,949
This phone has
a voice recording app.

751
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,868
Wu-ri's brother hid it for me.

752
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:16,828
We've come this far.

753
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,872
You think Plan B
was my only option?

754
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:25,045
Let's go to class.

755
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,070
Just to remind you,

756
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,239
in this game, Baek Ha-rin
and Seong Su-ji

757
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,449
will not be able
to vote for others.

758
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,910
Keep that in mind as you vote.

759
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,079
Then, let's begin

760
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:00,914

785
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,078
-Did you...
-Stop it!

786
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,209
Are you a stalker?

787
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,878
Will you just stop?

788
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,422
You're seriously scaring me now.

789
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,157
Okay!

790
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,784
Class rep,
did you record everything?

791
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,412
Guys, get together!

00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,958
INVITE TO GROUP
JAE-HYEONG, JI-AE

793
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,212
Su-ji told you guys, right?

794
00:53:36,421 --> 00:53:38,632
Not to vote for her.

795
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,468
But let's vote for her anyway.

796
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:43,470
Things have changed now.

797
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,305
It has.

798
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,015
You can say I'm acting
like a goody-goody again,

799
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:49,059
but we're going to vote for you.

800
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,645
That's what we've decided.

801
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,565
Good.

802
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,651
What?

803
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,402
I was only going to be the F
when there was a camera.

804
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,820
We still have the recorder,

805
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,322
but it isn't visually
effective as a camera.

806
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,115
Becoming the F doesn't
make sense anymore.

807
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,368
So, we're moving on to Plan C.

808
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,578
Ye-rim is going to vote for us.

809
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:13,291
Jae-hyeong alone isn't enough.
We have to count Ji-ae out now.

810
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,418
Also,

811
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,713
if I'm right, you're
Ha-rin's target.

812
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:22,133
She wants to make
you the F again.

813
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:24,302
In order to stop that,
we need someone dependable

814
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,179
in addition to you, me,
and Jae-hyeong.

815
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,764
And that's Ye-rim?

816
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:31,184
I told you to be careful
about Eun-jeong.

817
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,228
Keep your distance for a while.

818
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,271
How?

819
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,023
Hint to your other friends

820
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,109
to drop Eun-jeong's rank.

821
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,777
That way, people will stop

822
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,988
doubting you for
what happened today.

823
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,489
And it's better
for Eun-jeong that way too.

824
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:45,657
And?

825
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,909
Like I said,
the girls will vote for you.

826
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,829
You vote for me,
Ja-eun, and Ji-ae.

827
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:53,873
Let's do away with the F.

828
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,755
I lost?

829
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,757
To you, Seong Su-ji?

830
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,678
This is just the beginning.

831
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,412
It was a mistake

832
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:34,456
keeping Su-ji close to you.

833
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:36,249
Let's stop this, Ha-rin.

834
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,251
Stop doing this to the others.

835
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:39,419
The more you act
like this, you...

836
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,212
Then why did you do that to me?

837
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,423
You did it to me too.

838
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,343
You've been wondering,
haven't you?

839
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:50,138
Why you've been the F.

840
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,600
Seong Su-ji.

841
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:00,440
Well, that was quick.

842
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,733
And you didn't know
anything, did you?

843
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,193
Clueless as always.

844
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,111
It was because of Ja-eun.

845
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,697
The reason you were an F.

846
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:10,283
It was because of Ja-eun

847
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,868
that I was an F?

848
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,999
So all that bullying

849
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:20,627
was because of her?

850
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,547
That's bullshit.
Why was that because of her?

851
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:25,965
It was because of you.

852
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,342
Ra Hae-jun, Joo Seung-ie,

853
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,968
Pyo Ji-ae, me,
and Myeong Ja-eun...

854
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,470
You assigned girls from ordinary

855
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,263
and average
families into this class.

856
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:35,266
Girls with weaknesses
and easy for you to handle.

857
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,852
Then, what is Ja-eun's weakness?

858
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:40,063
I wondered for a while.

859
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,357
I don't know what
kind of dramatic

860
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,234
past you and Ja-eun share,

861
00:56:44,317 --> 00:56:45,902
but I'm on to you now.

862
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,530
You want to keep Ja-eun

863
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:51,324
as an F, for always.

864
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,329
And if I do?

865
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,705
Ja-eun, you answer.

866
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,541
Do you want to stay as an F?

867
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,843
No.

868
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,971
I don't.

869
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:04,082
