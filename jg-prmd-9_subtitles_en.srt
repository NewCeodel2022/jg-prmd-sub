00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,399
YE-RIM, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT? HAHA

4
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:31,865
See you at the pool.

5
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,812
Ye-rim, you're so pretty.

6
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,273
Ye-rim!
You're so pretty.

7
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,484
Congrats on your debut.

CONGRATS ON YOUR DEBUT

9
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,412
The 16th Pyramid Game.

10
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,335
Before we begin,

11
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,713
Ha-rin, you have
something to say?

12
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:22,058
I think we should pick
a permanent F at today's game.

13
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,935
Permanent...

14
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,396
F.

15
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,149
Permanent F.

16
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,527
That person will be an F
until we graduate.

17
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,704
An F until we graduate?

18
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,539
We're playing this
next year too?

19
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,875
-I know.
-One more year.

20
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,255
Does anyone want
to volunteer to be

21
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,632
the permanent F?

22
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,492
Seong Su-ji.

EPISODE 9

28
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,796
Because of you, Ye-rim...

29
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,838
Ye-rim?

30
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,048
What about Ye-rim?

31
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,425
Ye-rim...

32
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,929
You mean, the sirens
we heard just now?

33
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,849
Are you satisfied?
Because of the game you made,

34
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,559
Cho Wu-ri stays locked
up in her room all day,

35
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:30,353
Ja-eun slit her wrist,

36
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,314
and Eun-jeong might
not ever swim again.

37
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,276
And now, Ye-rim.

38
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,745
You all know that Baek Ha-rin
is the one who made the game,

39
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,455
don't you?

40
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,546
Go to your seat, Su-ji.

41
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:01,259
Yes, I made the game.

42
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,556
You'll have to do
exactly as I say from now on.

43
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,059
Like I was saying,

44
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,313
I'll be accepting volunteers
to be the permanent F.

45
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,358
What? Permanent F?

46
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,487
She wouldn't, that dork...

47
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,579
Why do we have to pick
a permanent F?

48
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,913
Rather,

49
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,916
how can you guarantee
that the F will be permanent?

50
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,418
What?

51
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,589
This text.

52
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,673
THE AS WILL SOON BE DECIDING
ON A PENALTY FOR KIM DA-YEON

53
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:43,843
You failed to penalize Da-yeon
through the game in the end.

54
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,930
So how can we believe you?

55
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:51,684
That's what
you're basing this on?

56
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,811
Because of that one time?
The only time?

57
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,064
You only got transferred here
a few weeks ago, and you think

58
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,066
you know everything about
the past two years of our class?

59
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,777
I may be the new girl, but I can
still say I don't trust you.

60
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,695
Even if you're the one
who made the game,

61
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,489
this is my game too now.

62
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,495
I agree with Ha-rin.

63
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:12,622
Park Ji-young, what about you?

64
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,295
Do you agree to
having a permanent F?

65
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,630
Huh?

66
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,298
Oh...

67
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,675
Sounds good to me.

68
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,511
What about you guys?

69
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,305
Yang So-young. Do Mi-yeong.

70
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,439
No.

71
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,733
Don't raise your hand, Ja-eun.

72
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,244
I have to stop this.

73
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,663
Fine, then let's decide
this together.

74
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,207
We'll start with whether
to pick a permanent F or not.

75
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,168
If the girls agree to your
proposal, I'll accept it.

76
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,838
But whatever happens, you
have to accept the results too.

77
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,840
We're all in the game after all.

78
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,762
And I'm going
to put a stop to it.

79
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,389
What?

80
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,766
What about you guys?

81
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,018
Who are you going to pick
as the permanent F?

82
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,229
The friend sitting next to you?

83
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,231
Or behind you?

84
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,338
I don't want to do that anymore.

85
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,924
Because we're friends.

86
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,689
What brings a tower down,

87
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,525
can surprisingly
be a small stone.

88
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,194
Cho Wu-ri.

89
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,613
Myeong Ja-eun.

90
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,699
Sim Eun-jeong.

91
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,869
And Im Ye-rim.

92
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:19,207
The next

93
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,418
could be any one of you.

94
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,591
Are you still going to play?

95
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,391
If someone
who isn't a lower rank than me,

96
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,435
but an A rank who
everyone looked up to,

97
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,395
someone like Ye-rim, the idol

98
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,980
of our class,
took drastic measures,

99
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,524
this could get through to them.

100
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,901
They'll finally
realize that this game

101
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:49,737
will destroy not just the F,
but everyone.

102
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:54,116
Up until now, the game was a
lower version created by Ha-rin,

103
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,078
but looks like
you've found a way.

104
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:01,040
You and Ja-eun have created
a hybrid version.

105
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:05,127
If you no longer want to
participate in this insane game,

106
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,464
delete the app and stand up.

107
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,093
If we have a majority,
this game will be gone for good.

108
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,304
If not, we'll choose
a permanent F.

109
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,308
What do you think?

110
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,644
You always said so yourself,

111
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,147
the Pyramid Game
is everyone's game.

112
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,236
Fine, let's do it.

113
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,328
The reason you're so confident

114
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,872
is because of Ja-eun, isn't it?

115
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,291
I'll...

116
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,836
be the F.

117
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,845
Please, just this once.

118
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,514
Don't do anything, Ja-eun.

119
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,445
PYRAMID GAME

120
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,202
I deleted it.

121
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,380
You're not going to make
Ja-eun the F?

122
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,965
The F is going to be Su-ji.

123
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,302
-How?
-Su-ji will never betray Ja-eun.

124
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,889
If Ja-eun volunteers to be the F,
she'll try to stop her.

125
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,183
I want Ja-eun to know
what it feels like

126
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,393
to have a friend
going through hell again.

127
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,312
Since Ja-eun is such a softie,

128
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,731
that'll be much more
tormenting for her.

129
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,581
Anyone else who deleted it?

130
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:12,004
We need at least 12.
Twelve to be in the majority.

131
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,219
THE PYRAMID GAME
HAS BEEN DELETED

132
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,429
Me.

133
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,684
DELETE THE PYRAMID GAME?

134
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,272
I deleted it too.

135
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,822
PYRAMID GAME

136
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,323
DELETE THE PYRAMID GAME?

137
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,047
DELETE THE PYRAMID GAME?

138
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,315
DELETE THE PYRAMID GAME?

139
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:38,215
Choi Yu-hyun is Baekyeon Group's
scholarship student.

140
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:41,218
GIRL GROUP TRAINEE
L'S ANTI-FAN ACCOUNT

141
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,346
Choi Yu-hyeon, Joo Seung-ie.

142
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,476
It wouldn't be interesting
without betrayers.

143
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,312
But that means...

144
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,581
DELETE THE PYRAMID GAME?

145
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:17,546
Huh?
Hey, you guys...

146
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,305
One more.

147
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,316
Just one more.

148
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,569
Please.

149
00:13:52,581 --> 00:13:54,083
Oh well, Ha-rin.

150
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,501
Baek Ha-rin.

151
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,174
I messed up.

152
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,928
Kim Da-yeon,
your vote doesn't count.

153
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:07,763
What are you even doing here?

154
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,098
-What?
-Ye-won.

155
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:12,059
Does Da-yeon have access
to the 16th Pyramid Game?

156
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,019
No, she was blocked.

157
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,730
Did you hear that? You're
no longer part of this class.

158
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,275
You're being transferred out
because of your bullying.

159
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,026
Shit.

160
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,404
Hey!
You think you can do this to me?

161
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,613
You don't have enough
votes without me!

162
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,407
We still don't need your vote.

163
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,575
Don't you get it?

164
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,619
You have no right
so stay out of it.

165
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,372
You fucking bitch!

166
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,458
Damn it!

167
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,129
Get off me!

168
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,255
Damn you!

169
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,840
I should've made sure

170
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,509
you'd never walk again
when you were an F.

171
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:46,844
You fucking bitch!

172

X GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL
CLASS X-X

173
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,145
Hey!

174
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,147
Isn't this class 2-5...

175
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,857
What is this?

176
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,819
You're nothing but a misfit.

177
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,494
Damn it!

178
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,842
What, you bitch...

179
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,803
Shit.

180
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,269
Let go!

181
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:40,022
Let go, let go!

182
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,399
Bitch!

183
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,903
I'm gonna kill you!

184
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:49,156
I'm gonna kill you!

185
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,201
PYRAMID GAME

186
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,535
DELETE THE PYRAMID GAME?

187
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,953
I deleted...

188
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,835
The game.

189
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,594
You still have no intention

190
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,013
of crossing over the line?

191
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,724
The girls have already
started to change.

192
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,518
I know you sense it too.

193
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,440
Then,

194
00:16:24,441 --> 00:16:26,902
at least help within
your little circle.

195
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,155
I'm going to stop the game today.

196
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,580

DELETE THE PYRAMID GAME?

199
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,112
PYRAMID GAME DELETED

200
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,873
With the exception of Ye-rim

201
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,709
and Eun-jeong who aren't here,

202
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,627
there are 22 of us.

203
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:30,007
Twelve for, ten against.

204
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:34,511
The majority has agreed
to stop the game,

205
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,015
and now,

206
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,693
the game is gone.

JUNIOR CLASS TEACHER'S OFFICE

00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,290
THE VIDEO HAS BEEN REMOVED

210
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:47,459
During the live streaming

211
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,461
make sure the video
isn't cut off or removed.

212
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,171
The problem is, the other side

213
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,549
will be monitoring
anything about Kim Da-yeon.

214
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,551
We need a way to keep
them occupied.

215
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,511
The recordings.

216
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,887
Can you post them

217
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,556
with the hashtag "KDY"?

218
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:04,351
We'll make them focus on that
as we stream the classroom.

JUNIOR CLASS TEACHER'S OFFICE

220
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,992
It's gonna be a shitstorm
after the live stream.

221
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,201
It better be.

222
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,078
There's more to
this than bullying.

223
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,873
There's a reason why Mr. Im
was leeching off class 2-5.

224
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:29,209
I think Go Eun-byeol,
Jeong Yeon-du and possibly others

225
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:32,296
were involved in grade tampering.

00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,933

231
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,790
What?

232
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,337
Where is it?

233
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,176
Dang it...

234
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,012
Why, you little...

235
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,890
Find the camera, now!

236
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:38,278
Give it to me.

237
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:58,715
Are you all crazy?

238
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,512
-OMG, what was that?
-Are they all nuts?

239
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,764
-Was that a fake documentary?
-No, it was the real thing.

240
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,182
What game?
Pyramid Game?

241
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:09,726
-I hope all bullies die.
-Damn, my eyes.

242
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,020
Who's Baek Ha-rin?
She made the game?

243
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,981
My friend went to
the Baekyeon Festival,

244
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,816
and apparently, Im Ye-rim
was taken away in an ambulance.

245
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:16,900
Baekyeon High School
is in panic mode.

246
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,819
-Why? Is it Kim Da-yeon again?
-See for yourself.

-Which school?
-Baekyeon Girls' High School.

251
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,999
You had me worried for a sec.

252
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,710
I thought you might volunteer
to be the permanent F.

253
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,880
Yeah, I was going to.

254
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,217
I thought if I just went back
to being the F again,

255
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,594
no one else could get hurt.

256
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,849
But I was wrong.

257
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,143
The game was hurting everyone.

258
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,186
Even Ha-rin herself.

259
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,565
She was actually enjoying it.
Using me as an excuse.

260
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,066
That's why...

261
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,321
I felt I had to stop it.

262
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,743
Thanks.

263
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:12,456
You set everything
in motion today.

264
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,592
Please leave a message...

265
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:26,136
Do you know another number we can
call other than Ye-rim's phone?

266
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,597
What are we going to do?
Her phone is still off.

267
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:29,848
You think Eun-jeong knows?

268
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,767
What happened to Ye-rim?

269
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,310
Is she badly hurt?

270
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,896
Oh...

271
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,651
Um...

272
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:48,950
Hey.

273
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,142
Eun-jeong, it's me.

274
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,145
Hey!

275
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,272
You better work
super hard at rehab.

276
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,398
Got that?

277
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,652
If you never swim again,
I'm going to kill you myself.

278
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,446
Do you hear me? Eun-jeong!

279
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,950
Hey! Stop!

280
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,077
Hey!

281
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,920
You! You're a stalker,
aren't you?

282
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,756
I saw you on Instagram!
You're a stalker!

283
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:47,509
Damn it.

284
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:50,303
Hey! Hey!

285
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,472
Stop right there!

286
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,729
You're hilarious, Su-ji.

287
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,940
So the girls think
something happened to me?

288
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,859
I didn't say that exactly,

289
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,069
but that's what everybody thinks.

290
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,320
Oh my god.

291
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,446
Sorry.

292
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,908
I needed to bluff for the game.

293
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,120
Lee Bo-hyeon and Cha Seon-ju
helped out because of you.

294
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,539
I told you, she's something else.

295
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,374
Bo-hyeon and Seon-ju?

296
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,337
You're not hurt?

297
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,090
I'm totally fine.
The stalker was caught too.

298
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,968
The police called so my mom
and dad went to the station.

299
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,597
It was some woman in her 30s.

300
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:36,600
Why did my mom make me
so likeable to women?

301
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,771
I'm kidding.

302
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:45,483
The stalker will be charged
and fortunately, I'm safe.

303
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,736
Those anti-fans
don't scare me a bit.

304
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,821
I did nothing wrong.

305
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,659
Will you guys smile now?

306
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,581
Guys, smile.

307
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:08,215
I heard you kept your promise
about stopping the game.

308
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,803
I still can't believe it.

309
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,723
It feels a little...

310
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,684
Oh, right. What are we
going to tell our moms and dads?

311
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,977
It's all over the internet.

312
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,689
It's too late to cover it up now.
Just tell them

313
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,942
it's a crazy high school.

314
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,368
You're going home, right?

315
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,827
No, to the convenience store first.

316
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,412
I have something
to return anyway.

317
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:40,789
Su-ji!

318
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:51,967
Thanks.

I copied it from the homeroom

321
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,775
I had some time left
and I was bored.

322
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,820
-This is a crime.
-And hidden cameras are legal?

323
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,322
Since when?
Today?

324
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,660
I took a brief look
but there's nothing on bullying.

You're here to report bullying?

327
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:26,167
Do you know
the personal information

328
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,502
of the perpetrator and victim?

329
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,964
Oh, first,
can you tell me your name?

330
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,345
It's Yun Na-hee.

331
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,889
I was a contract teacher

332
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,350
at Baekyeon Girls' High School
until October of this year.

333
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,853
Oh, you have a photo
of your sister, right?

334
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,688
The group photo you
showed me last time.

335
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,440
I don't have that right now.

336
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,901
I have a different one.

337
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,864
But...

338
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,950
Why do you want to see her photo?

339
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,370
That's her.

340
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,706
Wu-ri

341
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,459
was at the school earlier.

342
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,795
What?

343
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:22,932
Where have you been?

344
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,481
Ye-rim, I'm in Busan too.

345
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,066
This must be fate.

346
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,568
Ye-rim, the lights
in your room just went out.

347
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,903
Good night.

348
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:36,988
Read the DM.

349
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,491
Read the DM.

350
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:43,578
I told you not to smile
for other bitches!

351
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,580
Why aren't you reading my DMs?
Are you cheating on me?

352
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,415
Just wait.
I'm going to your school.

353
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,709
Cheaters need to be
taught a lesson.

354
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,129
I'm at your school.

355
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,256
But you're smiling
at other bitches again.

356
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,926
Cheaters need
to be taught a lesson.

357
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,987
Be brave one more time, Wu-ri.

358
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,492
Your three o'clock.

359
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,869
I'm watching you,
you fucking bitch.

360
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,126
Remember what you said?

361
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,378
YOU DID NOTHING WRONG
I'LL GET YOU OUT OF THAT ROOM

362
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,803
Ye-rim told me everything.

363
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,847
When you became a junior,

364
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,849
and even though
you were no longer an F,

365
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,393
you got up the courage
to tell the homeroom teacher.

366
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:56,109
-You did the right thing.
-Because she helped me.

367
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,277
What?

368
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,778
Ye-rim

369
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,156
tried to help me too.

370
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,912
Let's be brave one more time,

371
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,081
Wu-ri.

372
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,629
How's Ye-rim?

373
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,922
She'll be out
of the hospital soon.

374
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,299
Really?

375
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,604
What a relief.

376
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,774
Here.

377
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:41,362
Can you give this back to Ye-rim?

378
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,532
She dropped it.

379
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,035
Okay.

380
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,709
Wu-ri.

381
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,212
Yeah?

382
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,255
You did good.

383
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,433
Get out.

384
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,977
Get out!

385
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,827
DO-AH

386
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,373
It's me.

387
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:34,916
Kim Da-yeon!

388
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,584
Kim Da-yeon, you bitch.
where are you?

389
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,336
Find her, quickly.

390
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,004
Bring her to me.

391
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,256
Right now!

392
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,260
A live streaming exposed
bullying at a girls' high school

393
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,970
sending shock waves.

394
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,763
At a prestigious
high school in Seoul,

395
00:30:48,846 --> 00:30:51,307
a junior student was caught
on camera beating up

396
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,643
a fellow student
which was live streamed.

397
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,853
A video titled "High school girls

398
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,189
choosing outcasts by a
popularity vote" May I come in?

399
00:30:58,273 --> 00:30:59,566
The commander...

400
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:04,445
The video shows students
being exposed to school violence.

401
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,074
A girl punches another girl
not just in the face

402
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,784
but beats her entire body.

403
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:11,744
The class in the video played

404
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,913
something called the
"Pyramid Game."

405
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,665
Seon-hee.

406
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,751
Doesn't your daughter
go to this school?

407
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,962
Baekyeon Group's school?

408
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,797
This is the school, right?

409
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:06,299
You can get me transferred
to a new school, right?

410
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,302
It doesn't have to be in Seoul.

411
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:13,222
Just make sure Myeong Ja-eun
comes with me.

412
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,600
Are you out of your mind?

413
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:17,977
Do you not understand
what you did?

414
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:21,439
-You can't?
-Is that what you want?

415
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,108
Mother.

416
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,154
Ha-rin.

417
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,990
I promised you

418
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,202
that I'd give you everything

419
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,913
as long as you
didn't act foolish.

420
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:43,044
Do you still want to be
transferred out?

421
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,674
Yes.

422
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:54,555
Your eyes have no focus.
You foolish girl!

423
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,578
Why didn't you tell me?

424
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,330
You told me to learn

425
00:33:20,206 --> 00:33:23,251
how to solve things on my own
if a problem arises.

426
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,627
What?

427
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,600
Okay, just wait.

428
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:41,102
I'll be there soon.

429
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,439
Su-ji.

430
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,275
If that's what you
call an excuse...

431
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:50,069
I thought you'd just ignore it
even if I told you.

432
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,074
No, don't report it
to the higher-ups!

433
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,539
Keep your mouth shut.

434
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,208
It wasn't assault.
It's still an accident for now.

435
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,628
I'll do it. I'll investigate
the matter myself.

436
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,006
Calm down and go back to work.

437
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,133
You ignored it.

438
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,684
That was...

439
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,025
I told you to wait!

440
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,819
Okay, just wait.

441
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:44,165
You're back?

442
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,583
Mom.

443
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:00,848
Wash your hands.

444
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,518
I steamed some fish
I got from Jagalchi Market.

445
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,436
Let's eat.

446
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,109
Mom...

447
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,532
I'm sorry.

448
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,955
For not knowing.

449
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,751
I'm sorry.

450
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,713
I'm sorry.

451
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,882
I'm sorry...

452
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:40,137
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

453
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,103
HOMEROOM TEACHER'S FILES

454
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,184
Don't go to school today.

455
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,186
In fact, I think you
should transfer.

456
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,898
-I'll go to your school tomorrow.
-I'm okay.

457
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,482
I have friends.

458
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,526
See you later.

459
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,486
Be careful.

460
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:38,988
-Okay.
-Okay?

461
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:52,293
What is it?

462
00:36:52,418 --> 00:36:53,419
Huh?

463
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,838
Oh, nothing.

464
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,715
See you later.

465
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,975
Did you see the comments?

466
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,061
No.

467
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,980
Seems like the only
thing people want to know

468
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,649
is if I'm a psycho or not.

469
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,859
What do you think?

470
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,616
Stop wrecking yourself.

471
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:28,204
-I know now.
-What?

472
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,873
What do you know?

473
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:33,334
That you destroyed
yourself so easily

474
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,003
because I was here.

475
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,967
You're wrong.

476
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,344
You really do
have a bad memory.

477
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,097
You want me to tell you
what you should've known?

478
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,226
No.

479
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,853
I'm not going to use you
as an excuse anymore.

480
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:54,981
So-eun.

481
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,721
Let's go. Move it.

482
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,014
-Come on.
-Get to class.

483
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,974
Hurry up.

484
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:32,018
Isn't that the girl
from the video?

485
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,484
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

486
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,127
So many empty seats.

487
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,756
I'm sure a lot of parents
didn't want their kids to come.

488
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,953
Oh my.

489
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,707
Go Eun-byeol didn't even
bother to come?

490
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:40,044
You girls...

491
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,546
Eun-byeol!

492
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,507
What has gotten into you?

493
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,675
What if I don't get
into a top university?

494
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:50,387
You have to consult a lawyer
before I get expelled!

495
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,764
Come on!

496
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,141
Geez!
You're impossible!

497
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,476
Get your act together!

498
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,186
What is wrong with you?

499
00:39:57,311 --> 00:39:59,188
We might as well
just die together.

500
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:01,649
This is all your fault!
Yours and dad's!

501
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:04,193
Why did you have
to live like losers?

502
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,320
Why did you even have me?
Why?

503
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,614
Why did you make me so ordinary?

504
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,157
Why?

505
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:19,500
This girl.

506
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,002
Send her abroad.

507
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,381
Call Attorney Kim
and get the paperwork done.

508
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,424
Yes, Mother.

509
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:37,935
Grandmother.

510
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,042
We need an exit strategy.

511
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,880
The lawyers will take care of
the things they can.

512
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,298
But first, the kids...

513
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,842
We can't disgrace
the name of Baekyeon

514
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:12,136
to protect your daughter.

515
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:18,517
You're going to blame
my daughter for everything?

516
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,394
Don't worry.

517
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,021
My daughter too.

518
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:25,524
The school wasn't
aware of anything,

519
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,359
but promises to
deal with it swiftly

520
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,153
and make sure it
doesn't happen again.

521
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,237
Director Choi.

522
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,281
My priority is Baekyeon Group.

523
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,074
Not my daughter.

524
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,412
And certainly not you.

525
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:44,877
The girls I'm calling

526
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,046
will move their desks to Class 1.

527
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:52,593
Oh Seong-ah, Myeong Ja-eun,
Shin Shin-ye, and Im Ye-rim.

528
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,053
Next,

529
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:59,308
Seong Su-ji, Jeong Yeon-du,
Song Jae-hyeong,

530
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:02,978
Go Eun-byeol, Bang Wu-ie,
you girls are in Class 2.

531
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,737
You're the only one
in another class.

532
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,240
-Will you be okay?
-I'm okay.

533
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:16,325
Let's have lunch together instead.

534
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:17,952
Okay.

535
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:48,065
So, is that video true or not?

536
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,779
We're looking closely
into the matter

537
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,572
and Class 5 has
been reassigned

538
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,408
to prevent this
from happening again.

539
00:42:57,491 --> 00:43:00,035
We'll do everything we can

540
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,080
to sort this out
as soon as possible.

541
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,665
NO ENTRY

542
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,583
Make sure the girls
don't come near this building.

543
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:07,835
Yes, ma'am.

544
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,229
Aunt.

545
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,441
How much do you have
in your hidden account?

546
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,193
Just be straight with me.

547
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:34,862
Huh?

548
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,864
I know you've taken
a lot of kickbacks.

549
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,575
Shut up!
Shut your trap!

550
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,785
Argh!

551
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:45,873
Hey, Ye-rim.

552
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:48,083
-Ye-rim.
-Hi.

553
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,335
Is it okay to come back
to school so soon?

554
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,378
Yes.
How have you been?

555
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,093
We're in the same class.

556
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,428
Hi.

557
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,514
The traits of organisms

558
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,601
are determined by
the genetic code in DNA.

559
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,771
The genome sequence that
stores the genetic code

560
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,815
are called genes.
In general, genes...

561
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,754
Who knew the cafeteria
could be so loud?

562
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,130
Yeah.

563
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,353
I heard Ha-rin was sent abroad.

564
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,897
-Abroad?
-It didn't cross your mind?

565
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,400
It's a pretty common ending.

566
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,905
She went abroad? So-eun...

567
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,574
So-eun?

568
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,535
I mean, Ha-rin?

569
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,080
If you think about it,
it's the most realistic ending.

570
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,166
I never really thought that
those girls would get

571
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:56,503
what they deserved just because
the game was exposed.

572
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,175
I wonder what Ha-rin
was really trying to do?

573
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:04,261
You said you wanted
to tell me something

574
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,762
when the game was gone for good.

575
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,473
Can you tell me now?

576
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:12,853
Yes.

577
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:32,748
Where did Ja-eun go again?

578
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,708
We were supposed
to walk home together.

579
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,127
Where's Su-ji?
You're in the same class.

580
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,671
I don't know.
She left on her own.

581
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:42,841
Guys!

582
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:54,478
Hey, I have a text.
The girls are coming over.

583
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:55,896
Why?

584
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,024
I told you to be nicer
to the girls.

585
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,943
Okay, fine.

586
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,330
They read it immediately.

587
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:23,590
So funny.

588
00:47:33,267 --> 00:47:35,102
Ye-rim!

589
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,604
Hey.

590
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,111
Oh, they felt awkward

591
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,071
and asked me to come
along with them.

592
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:47,990
Bo-hyeon and Seon-ju
played a huge part,

593
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,575
but Yeon-du...

594
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,076
Oh, oops!

595
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,078
Didn't see you there.

596
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:54,454
That's blusher on
your cheeks, right?

597
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,291
Your face isn't red because
you're too embarrassed

598
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,834
to face them, right?

599
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,962
Geez, you're so annoying.

600
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,841
-Yeon-du bought this for you.
-Is your leg okay?

601
00:48:05,966 --> 00:48:06,800
Yes.

602
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,302
Geez.

603
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,847
Su-ji and Ja-eun didn't come by,
did they?

604
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,350
Oh, we can't reach them.

605
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:16,810
Why not?

606
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,729
They're not getting into
trouble again, are they?

607
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:21,148
You don't think something
is going on, do you?

608

What is it?

When I was in elementary school,

613
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,274
I didn't something bad to Ha-rin.

614
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,986
Something really bad.
