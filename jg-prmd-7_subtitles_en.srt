00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:07,757
The reason I trembled
in front of Ha-rin that day...

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,968
This was why.

3
00:00:13,847 --> 00:00:15,181
Because of fear.

00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,725
Let's go.

13
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,562
Let's go, guys.
Come on.

14
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,408
Look, a shark.

00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,924
Hey, do you know
Ja-eun's Instagram ID?

17
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:07,937
Eun-byeol.

18
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,314
You're gonna hang
out with Ha-rin

19
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,857
during free time
Ha-rin later, right?

20
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,442
Can I come with?

21
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,037
So pretty.

22
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,988
How are you going to
destroy the game? Any spoilers?

23
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,823
Can you tell me
who else contacted you?

24
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,785
You're going to take
full blame if this fails, right?

25
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:08,706
The other girls?

26
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:11,000
How many have
reached out so far?

27
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,461
At least they're
feeling things out.

28
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,297
Public opinion is wavering.
We can do this!

29
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,134
Hey, they reached
out to me too.

30
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,179
-Seong-ah, Sin-ae, and...
-Let me see.

31
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,349
What? Ji-young? Cut her off!

32
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,811
She's a spy, 100%.

33
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,480
Her parents work at
Baekyeon Food.

34
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,525
What happened
with the recordings though?

35
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,318
You said you were going to
release them this weekend.

36
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,569
Oh, yeah.

37
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:39,737
What happened?

38
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,825
It's not supposed to be such an
ordinary day enjoying the sun.

39
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,830
I was thinking
we should push it...

40
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,518
Let's go.

41
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,729
Huh?

42
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,981
-Help me up.
-Sure.

43
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,248
Can you anticipate
how far I'll go?

46
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,763
How does it feel
betraying your friends?

47
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:50,016
Are you disappointed in yourself?

48
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:52,351
Do you regret
not transferring out?

49
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,606
It's not too late.

50
00:05:56,856 --> 00:05:59,859
-Run when you still can.
-Why?

51
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,907
Why are you doing this?
What is it that you want?

52
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,492
What do I want?

53
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:15,750
A rift.
Betrayal.

54
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,253
You guys shattering
into little pieces.

55
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,343
Ta-da!

56
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,137
-Got us some tiramisu!
-Thanks.

57
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,430
Here.

58
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,605
DAD

59
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,318
Hello?

60
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,694
How's your trip?

61
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,321
Busan, is it?

62
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,031
Yes.

63
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,283
Okay.

64
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,745
Have a good time
during your three days there.

65
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,913
See you.

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,997
Dad.

67
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,124
What?

68
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,838
Never mind.

69
00:07:07,218 --> 00:07:08,803
Congrats, Ye-rim.

70
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,056
You're in the debuting team.

71
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,184
MESSAGE

72
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,403
Hey.

73
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,905
Can you take a photo for us?

74
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,783
Oh, uh... Okay.

75
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,286
She said okay. Go, go, go.

76
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:37,582
On three, one two, three.

77
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,708
How should we pose next?

78
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,168
-The flower cup pose.
-Flower cup.

79
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,419
Are you all smiling?

80
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:42,879
What next?

81
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,213
-A heart.
-Okay.

82
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,062
I just got a text
from your coach

83
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:01,439
asking me to talk to you.

84
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,399
You're not competing
in the next meet?

85
00:08:03,482 --> 00:08:05,568
Are you crazy?
Have you gone completely nuts?

86
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,987
-Don't get so worked up, Ye-rim.
-You stay out of this.

87
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:09,739
It's because of me.

88
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:13,492
She agreed to be
my surfing buddy that day.

89
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,329
-What?
-Since I can't swim.

90
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,086
Can you give us some privacy?

91
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:28,049
It's okay.
Ye-rim will get to debut.

92
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:36,557
Hey. Don't go!
Eun-jeong!

93
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,770
You want Eun-jeong back?

94
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,275
It all depends on you.

95
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,944
Ye-rim.

96
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,754
I'm pretty sure
I took those in private.

97
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,340
How did you get these?

98
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,550
I know what I did was wrong.

99
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,719
And I won't do it again.

100
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,264
Anyway,
I'm not buying.

101
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,643
Your brother has an interview
at a law firm, doesn't he?

102
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,275
He'll be interviewed by Baekyeon
Group's former corporate lawyer.

103
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,151
I wonder what he'll do if he sees

104
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:30,903
these photos you've
been collecting?

105
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:35,783
Will the result of his interview
change or not?

106
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,499
After you're done
with your team activities,

107
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,668
meet back here
at the lobby, got it?

108
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,488
Is that actually fun?

109
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,845
It's more fun than you think.

110
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,555
And it isn't scary at all.

111
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,015
-It's not?
-Yep.

112
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,475
I should've signed up for it too.

113
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,393
What am I gonna do
about my hair?

114
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:55,446
Who's that?

115
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,281
-Isn't that Ha-rin?
-It's Ha-rin.

116
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:58,616
Really?

117
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,539
Ha-rin!

118
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:39,824
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I just slipped.

119
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,159
Da-yeon,
take your cardigan off.

120
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,203
Take it off, now.

121
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,123
Come on!

122
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,166
Can you get up?

123
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,713
The chlorine
is going to ruin your silky hair.

124
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,174
Are you cold?

125
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,656
Baek Ha-rin!

126
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,660
You fell in the pool?
Huh?

127
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,497
I'm so sorry.

128
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,040
And thank you.

129
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,543
I'll keep an eye on the girls.

130
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,170
Thank you.

131
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,046
Thank you.

132
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,510
Fighting in class wasn't enough?

133
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,679
Was this another "prank"?

134
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,222
Are you sure?

135
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,186
Ha-rin, are you okay?
Should I take you to a doctor?

136
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,687
You're all...

137
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,189
Will you shut up?

138
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,368
Shut up, sir.

139
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,128
Right, guess you don't need
a doctor for something so minor.

140
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,965
Do you want to go change?

141
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:22,885
I've never seen
her this crazy before.

142
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:48,744
Why did you do it?

143
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,207
What were you going
to do after pushing her in?

144
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,127
What?

145
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,755
What the fuck are
you talking about?

146
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,923
I saw you.

147
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,883
Don't do anything stupid.

148
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,969
Especially, something
you can't handle.

149
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,513
What?

150
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,099
What did I do?

151
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,894
Is this about Ha-rin?

152
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,230
Didn't you hear her?
She said she slipped.

153
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:23,195
I didn't mean to.

154
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,531
It was a mistake.

155
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,116
Really...

156
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,826
But...

157
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:33,163
Fuck, don't act so innocent.
I saw everything too.

158
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,873
Are you guys any different?

159
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,145
Ha-rin!

160
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,445
Let's drink up.

161
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,863
-Okay.
-Okay.

162
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,496
Actually,

163
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,500
I think that the game
the kids are playing

164
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,003
is getting a little out of hand.

165
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,422
Don't you think we
should discuss it?

166
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,090
It's just a game.

167
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,675
What's the big deal?

168
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:33,349
There's a Colonel I run into
sometimes while golfing

169
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,434
and a while ago, he was bragging

170
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,353
that the Chairman
of Baekyeon Group

171
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,104
extended a gesture of goodwill.

172
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,315
The father of the new girl
who came in the summer

173
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,316
is part of that unit.

174
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,986
The game seems to have gone
beyond the classroom,

175
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,530
and I think they
should be cautioned.

176
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,466
Hurry up
and find your own bags.

177
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,683
Thanks.

178
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,187
Check your bags.

179
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,273
Watch your head.

180
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,865
If you have your bags,
move inside.

181
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:34,410
-Move inside.
-Okay.

182
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,245
Move, move.

183
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,081
-Slowly.
-Move it.

184
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,501
Ha-rin, only our class
is staying at this hotel?

185
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:45,504
Where's our room? Is it a suite?

186
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,006
If you have your bags,
move inside.

187
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,175
-Come on, let's go.
-If you have...

188
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,261
Move inside.

189
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:55,389
Move inside.

190
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,439
Is it so hard
assigning your own rooms?

191
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,316
What's taking so long?
Five times five, 25.

192
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,568
Five in each house.

193
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,653
If you don't want me to assign
your rooms for you,

194
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,321
divide into groups, now.

195
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,823
Quickly.

196
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:14,450
Hae-jun, you want to room with us?

197
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,286
-We don't have five yet.
-Oh, okay. Come on.

198
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,830
Seong-ah, over here.

199
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:21,957
Okay.

200
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,755
-Shin-ye, wanna come?
-Huh?

201
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,339
Yes.

202
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,221
Do-ah, Da-yeon.

203
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,811
Eun-jeong, come on.

204
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:05,834
We're done.

205
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,377
Yeah?

206
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:11,173
Then why are there
three of you left?

207
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,674
Come on.

208
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,719
You three groups,
take one each.

209
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,055
Come on, let's unpack
and get dinner.

210
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:22,351
It's just one bomb after another.

211
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,936
Ah...

212
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,025
Ji-ae, over here.

213
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,033
Will you be okay?

214
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,202
Cho Yu-rim,
run, run, run.

215
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,456
Wow, I get to room with Ye-rim.
This is great.

216
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,625
I brought a lot
of facial masks too.

217
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,377
You want one later?

218
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,712
Were you and I friends?

219
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,757
So shameless.

220
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,134
The accommodations
are on your right.

221
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,719
Let's go. Move it.

222
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,228
What is that smell?

223
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,106
I smell a traitor.

224
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:13,026
Were you always like this?
You're not what I expected.

225
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:17,739
Yeah, and you're
the traitor who made Ja-eun an F.

226
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,575
She snitched on me?

227
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,035
Figures.

228
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:25,330
She only acts like
she wants to protect other girls.

229
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,167
I'm a victim in this too, you know.

230
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,253
You think I wanted to cut her off?

231
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,671
You think you wouldn't
betray anyone

232
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,881
if you were in the same situation?

233
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,341
All the girls in this class would
do exactly the same thing.

234
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,343
Ja-eun is no different.

235
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,264
Betrayal...

236
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,947
It's a wish. We can write
what we're craving to eat, right?

237
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,283
-That thing I mentioned...
-So, what are we doing?

238
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,870
We writing wishes to send
them up in lanterns later.

239
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,787
-Yeah.
-Oh.

240
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,205
What should we write, Ja-eun?

241
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,833
I'm gonna write
Ja-eun heart Jae-hyeong.

242
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,627
Calm down, Jae-hyeong.

243
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,045
Sheesh.

244
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,812
Here, the instructions.

245
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:07,224
Wow, there's ours.

246
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,567
So nice.

247
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:20,195
-It's pretty.
-Yeah.

248
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,668
-Right?
-Yeah.

249
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,211
She's sharp.

250
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,462
What'll happen?

251
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,179
Do what I say
when I tell you to.

252
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,764
I'll be in touch.

253
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,852
BAEK HA-RIN / DO WHAT I SAY WHEN
I TELL YOU TO. I'LL BE IN TOUCH

254
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,121
Ha-rin, you're working too hard.

255
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,915
I'll be your lady-in-waiting.

256
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,293
You be the princess of our class.

257
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,004
Those morons might
get the wrong idea.

258
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,214
They might think you're nervous.

259
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,432
It's all my fault.

260
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,685
I had too much free time today.
Right?

261
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,104
You're such a child.

262
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,273
I'll be your lady-in-waiting
all you want

263
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,858
as long as
I get into Hanguk University...

264
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:41,777
You want the next test papers?

265
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,780
I would appreciate that.

266
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,827
Just do what I tell you tomorrow.

267
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,621
And do it right this time.

268
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,290
Yeah, I'll do my best.

269
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,209
Should I go get
confirmation later?

270
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:18,522
Ja-eun.
How can you be so nice?

271
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,150
Yu-rim.

272
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,530
She's going to think
you've forgiven her.

273
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,244
I just...

274
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,496
I think we could've been friends

275
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,832
if it weren't for this game.

276
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,337
It just crossed my mind.

277
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,843
It's the same
with the other girls.

278
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,854
How did we end up like this?

279
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:08,613
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you

280
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,449
Happy birthday, dear Su-ji

281
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,702
Happy birthday to you

282
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,706
Happy b-day, Su-ji!

283
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,541
-Make a wish!
-Make a wish!

284
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,315
YE-RIM, I'M IN BUSAN TOO
THIS MUST BE FATE

285
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,157
HAVING FUN?
WITHOUT ME?

286
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,742
POST

287
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,834
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
HAVING A GOOD TIME

288
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,841
MY MESSAGES

289
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,593
If I had noticed

290
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,428
your red flags,

291
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,723
maybe you could've
been friends too.

292
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,230
IF I HAD NOTICED
YOUR RED FLAGS,

293
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:24,397
MAYBE YOU COULD'VE
BEEN FRIENDS TOO

294
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:27,150
Friends?

295
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:52,759
Okay, we're rolling.

296
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,594
Time for the strip show.

297
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:59,307
Damn it, don't make us wait.
Time is ticking.

298
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,392
CHO WU-RI

299
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,185
You're so fucking slow.

300
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:36,177
You did nothing wrong.
I'll get you out of that room.

301
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,613
DELETE

302
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:01,619
Wu-ri's face when she walked
back home all alone at night...

303
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,541
Is this what she looked like?

304
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,043
Yes.

305
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:09,711
Fucking terrified.

306
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:36,363
Did I thank you

307
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,366
for that day during dodgeball?

308
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,160
Want it?

309
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,037
Ah...

310
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,583
I really hate making excuses,
but since the app is my baby,

311
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,836
I feel like I'll be forever
labeled as one the bullies too.

312
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:54,130
If I'm being honest,
I was complicit.

313
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,466
And also,

314
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,386
I wasn't the only one trying
to stay on Ha-rin's good side.

315
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:05,141
Anyway, just let me know
if there's anything I can do.

316
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,937
I'll help this time.
I swear on my baby.

317
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,563
Why?

318
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:13,858
Because the ball that hit me

319
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,903
fucking hurt.

320
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,881
What do you want to do?

321
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,847
-Should we just go to bed?
-Let's go to bed.

322
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,140
Wait, wait, wait.

323
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,433
Hey, hey, hey.

324
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,517
Already?

325
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:49,519
-Then, a movie?
-Horror?

326
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,229
And fried chicken?

327
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,857
Are you insane?

328
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,151
Fried chicken at night
is just evil, guys.

329
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,610
Salad?

330
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,447
-I'm going to bed.
-Come on.

331
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,657
Okay, then chicken salad.

332
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,424
Oh, shit!

333
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,643
Ja-eun, you go.

334
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,645
I almost had a heart attack.

335
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,230
Go see who it is.

336
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,649
Who-who-who is it?

337
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,117
-What is all that?
-Huh?

338
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,578
Spicy fried chicken.

339
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,541
I can't resist half-and-half
of original and spicy.

340
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:56,211
Today's my cheat day.
Bring it over!

341
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,879
Let's dig in!

342
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,223
Are we...

343
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,642
making you uncomfortable?

344
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:13,811
-No, why?
-Just asking.

345
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,439
You don't look so happy.

346
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:20,235
Yeah, Su-ji.
Are you not feeling well?

347
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:22,111
You've been down all day.

348
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,786
DELETE

349
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,288
I...

350
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,749
I've been wanting to talk to you.

351
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,585
When you said you were
going to get rid of the game,

352
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:40,129
you looked...

353
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,882
so cool.

354
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,095
I'm sorry, Su-ji.

355
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,598
For ignoring you before.

356
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,648
Want some cake?

357
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,900
We have some of
Su-ji's birthday cake left.

358
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,318
Yeah, sounds good.

359
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,820
I'll go get it.

360
00:31:18,084 --> 00:31:19,752
Happy b-day.

361
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,298
You did nothing wrong.

362
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,094
Su-ji, hurry up!

363
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,146
-Do you need a bag?
-No, I'm good.

364
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,607
That'll be 2,500 won.

365
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,076
Hey guys, focus.

366
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,163
Has anyone seen Ha-rin?

367
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,042
-She's not in her room?
-No, that's why I'm asking.

368
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,294
Crap.

369
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:06,466
I've always wanted to treat you
the way you treated the girls.

370
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,092
Fuck.

371
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,219
Da-yeon.

372
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,432
-Hey, I'm an A.
-So?

373
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,975
You'll be nothing
once we graduate.

374
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:16,976
Maybe you'll go to college,

375
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,686
get a job, and join the
rat race, but that's it.

376
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,313
-What about Ha-rin?
-What?

377
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,982
You just don't get it, do you?

378
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:26,319
The Pyramid Game will continue
even if we graduate.

379
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,237
Like an extended version.

380
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,198
Don't you see?

381
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,785
The Pyramid Game is Ha-rin.

382
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:41,709
Maybe she went out for a walk.

383
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,506
I need to discuss
tomorrow's big event.

384
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,559
Why...

385
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,728
Why aren't you
doing anything to me?

386
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,146
You turned around.

387
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,232
You saw me.

388
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,164
Someone other than you
pissed me off even more.

389
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,257
Don't worry.
You won't become an F.

390
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,175
You're nothing.

391
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,438
I'm gonna look terrible tomorrow.

392
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,107
-You're gonna be all puffy.
-You too.

393
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,650
Your face is puffy already.

394
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,277
Someone's phone is buzzing.

395
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,740
Here, Ja-eun.
Your phone.

396
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,743
Thanks.

397
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,456
Hello?

398
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:02,790
Mom.

399
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,264
-Ja-eun!
-Mom.

400
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,730
How have you been?

401
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:30,109
So-eun said I should come
see you since you're in Busan.

402
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,404
You're in the same
school and class?

403
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,699
Why didn't you tell me?
You used to be best friends.

404
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:39,952
Here, strawberries.

405
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:41,954
Share them with your friends.

406
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,957
They're sweeter than last year.

407
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,795
I wish I could give some to your
homeroom teacher,

408
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,215
but I don't want you girls
to get scolded because I came.

409
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:56,177
I'll get going.
You girls go in too.

410
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,265
I hope we get to see
each other more often.

411
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,059
With Ja-eun too.

412
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,702
It's a boarding school where
Pastor Hwang is a board member.

413
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,121
It's one of the best boarding
schools in the States.

414
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,540
Why do you want
to send Ha-rin away?

415
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:26,874
She should've gone sooner.

416
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,960
She doesn't need
a Korean education,

417
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:31,963
and I should've set her on the
path to an Ivy League school.

418
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,881
Pastor Hwang recommends it too.

419
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,508
-She can still...
-You're dismissed.

420
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,717
Mother.

421
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,222
This is the best you
could come up with?

422
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:45,601
Can't you be more
ambitious like Ha-rin?

423
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,563
You fool...

424
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:54,902
There's no knowing what she'll do.

425
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,472
Friends?

426
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,602
You heard her.

427
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,687
Your best friend

428
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,272
is So-eun.

429
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,524
That's why you jumped in.

430
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,276
Unlike the other girls.

431
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,570
Without any hesitation.

432
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,324
Ha-rin!

433
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,748
Your friendship

434
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,628
made me want to
kill you even more.

435
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:54,754
So-eun.

436
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,005
You hypocrite.

437
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,423
Stop.

438
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,718
Just stop.

439
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,553
Stop this.

440
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,264
If you don't care about your
mom finding out your secret,

441
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,059
then should we talk
about your mom?

442
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,102
-What...
-Oh.

443
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,314
By the way, Su-ji betrayed
you to protect her dad.

444
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,524
What will you do?

445
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,250
MYEONG JA-EUN

446
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,078
What? Who's there?

447
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,623
Su-ji? Why are you
wandering around

448
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,458
like a ghost in the
middle of the night?

449
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,668
Go back to bed.

450
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,005
You're out too?

451
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,424
Why you...

452
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,175
Where have you been?

453
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,428
Go back inside, now.

454
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,200
Are you okay?

455
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,038
Yes.

456
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,877
Things have been
a wreck in our class lately.

457
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,962
I know it must've
been tough on you.

458
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:03,841
Since there are no Fs,
the balance has been thrown off.

459
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:08,137
Today's game is a team game,

460
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,389
but it also includes
an individual game.

461
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,267
If you're shot more than three
times, there will be a penalty.

462
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,271
It'll be a little extreme since
you'll be taking the F's place.

463
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,014
Ja-eun.

464
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,726
-Last night, by any chance...
-It's okay.

465
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,230
We're supposed to
move on our own, right?

466
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,983
I'll go this way.

467
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,568
See you later.

468
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,868
Be careful.

469
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,569
This is fun.

470
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,321
You're out if you get shot
three times, right?

471
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:35,159
What?

472
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,495
You can miss a swim meet for me,
but you can't take the penalty?

473
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,129
It'll be a little extreme

474
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,215
since you'll be taking
the F's place.

475
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,758
Wu-ri dropped out of school?

476
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,219
She got a penalty for trying
to tell the teacher.

477
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,221
How bad was it for
her to drop out?

478
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,057
I don't know for sure,
but I heard it was a strip show.

479
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,914
Aren't you curious
what the penalty will be?

480
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,283
You bitch! If you hadn't
come to our school,

481
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,659
if it weren't for you...!

482
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,910
This is all your fault!

483
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:02,496
You and that outcast
Myeong Ja-eun! Shit!

484
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:17,636
Die!

485
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,680
Just die!

486
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,128
Don't act like you're the victim.

487
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,614
This is your limit, Ja-eun.

488
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:22,242
You're afraid of me, but you
can't help but feel guilty too.

489
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,455
You want your mom to be happy?

490
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,042
Then, betray your friends.

491
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:01,532
Those getting the penalty

492
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:04,451
are Seong Su-ji, Myeong Ja-eun,

493
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,245
Song Jae-hyeong,

494
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,540
and Sim Eun-jeong.

495
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:13,460
Just so you know,

496
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:16,630
Ha-rin isn't too
happy with team four.

497
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,382
The black vests.

498
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:20,259
Pyo Ji-ae?

499
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,104
Pyo Ji-ae.

500
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,648
Wanna trade rooms with me?

501
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:38,110
I'm not comfortable
with Ja-eun and the rest.

502
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,073
Anyway, the girls whose name
was called, step forward.

503
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,077
Class rep, I think we need
to hold a class meeting.

504
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,162
About what?

505
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,122
Today, we'll be

506
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,250
choosing the F.

507
00:45:57,337 --> 00:46:00,507
-Fs are chosen by votes.
-Our class needs an F.

508
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,721
Didn't you all feel it?

509
00:46:07,347 --> 00:46:09,433
That's the only way to be safe.

510
00:46:17,232 --> 00:46:18,358
You're such a loser.

511
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:21,111
-Hey.
-Ja-eun, are you listening?

512
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,155
Fuck, look at me
when I'm talking to you.

513
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:24,656
Where are your manners?

514
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,784
Don't you all feel uneasy?

515
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:32,164
Not knowing when or who
will fall to that spot.

516
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:39,421
That's why we'll be choosing
an F among you four.

517
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,423
That's today's penalty.

518
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,217
Who agrees?

519
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,427
Of course they'll
raise their hands.

520
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:47,221
As long as it's not them.

521
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,390
Safety in anonymity.

522
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,685
Bystanders.

523
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,585
Shin-ye, aren't you
going to raise your hand?

524
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,547
Huh? Oh...

525
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:28,720
I've been wanting
to talk to you.

526
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,948
The prisoner's dilemma.

527
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,450
Starting now, you will be

528
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:52,911
snitching on each other's faults.

529
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,663
Like this.

530
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,794
You acted like
you could get rid of the game.

531
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:04,381
Once you run out of paint balls,
the game is over.

532
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,341
Do your best to come up
with something.

533
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,468
The more you snitch
on your friends,

534
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,178
the more likely you'll survive.

535
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:16,184
Of course, if you all choose
to keep your mouths shut,

536
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,186
you'll all survive.

537
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:23,400
But what are the chances of that?

538
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,533
Betray your friends.

539
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,244
BAEK HA-RIN
BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS

540
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,248
BAEK HA-RIN
BETRAY YOUR FRIENDS

541
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,965
What I want?

542
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,176
A rift.

543
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,594
Betrayal.

544
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,513
You guys shattering
into little pieces.

545
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,309
Ja-eun left all alone.

546
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,328
Their faults... Their faults...

547
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,913
What could there be?

548
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:20,123
Faults...

549
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:23,251
What faults? Shit...

550
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,424
I betrayed

551
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,137
my friends.

552
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,771
I betrayed my friends.

553
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,607
I betrayed my friends.

554
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:31,361
I betrayed my friends.

555
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,632
Hey, are you fighting?

556
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:57,179
You know,

557
00:50:57,304 --> 00:51:00,432
I was blackmailed
for the first time ever earlier,

558
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,309
by Baek Ha-rin.

559
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,644
But there's something
she doesn't know.

560
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,856
I grew up getting beat up
by my brother.

561
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,651
Bad enough to pop the veins
in an eight-year-old's eyes.

562
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,696
I wouldn't mind messing up

563
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,948
his life a little.

564
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,534
Ye-rim,

565
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,952
will you be okay?

566
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,120
Sim Eun-jeong.

567
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:25,373
She saw how much I wanted
to make my debut,

568
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,335
but how can she give up on
her own dream so easily?

569
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,463
I can't be friends
with someone like that.

570
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,090
Did you hear that, Eun-jeong?

571
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:36,301
Have a good life.

572
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:45,018
I'm sorry.
I heard about your dad.

573
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,479
-It's my fault.
-Ja-eun.

574
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,523
Get your head on straight.

575
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,525
Yeah, let's make
one thing clear.

576
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:54,861
This isn't your fault.
It's that bitch, Ha-rin's.

577
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,488
What a total bitch.

578
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,033
And you,
don't feel bad.

579
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,369
It's only been delayed, right?

580
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,128
-You're not deleting it?
-That's what I meant to do.

581
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,006
I was scared.

582
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,468
But even so,

583
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,179
we might still
be able to use this later.

584
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,849
I'll talk it over with the girls.

585
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,396
The prisoner's dilemma,

586
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,274
A psychological game where
betrayal makes everyone lose,

587
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:36,069
but working together
benefits everyone.

588
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,552
Watch closely.

589
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:04,556
PYRAMID GAME
