00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:34,951
Hi.

6
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:46,212
I knew you'd come with her.

7
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,881
For a brief second

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,593
I thought about giving Ja-eun
a little hope.

9
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,803
So that she'd feel
even more hopeless

10
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,305
after being betrayed by you.

11
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:57,599
I should never have
brought you into this class.

12
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,059
Whatever.
What is this place?

13
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,352
Why did you tell Ja-eun
to come here?

14
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,898
So that she can see
what happens to me.

15
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,524
What?

16
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,072
Looks like the annex building
at our school, doesn't it?

17
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,949
Do you know what this place is?

18
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,702
Home.

19
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,371
My home.

20
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:28,171
This is where I live.

00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,593
Sky House?
You're the only one I'm telling.

23
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,722
I don't have a mom or a dad.

24
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,191
The little girl, Yang So-eun
who used to live here

25
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,652
was bullied.

26
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,737
That's me.

27
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,991
-Yang So-eun.
-What?

28
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:58,701
So-eun...

29
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,623
It was me...

30
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,881
What?

31
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:27,063
Hello, my name is So-eun.

32
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,773
I'm from Korea.

33
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,733
This is my friend, Ga-hee.

34
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,735
She's from Korea too.

35
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,362
Nice to meet you.

36
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,072
Very good.

37
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:37,907
Everyone, give her a hand!

38
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,333
Isn't Yang So-eun so annoying?

39
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:51,087
She acts like a princess.
I don't want to play with her.

40
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,131
Don't be like that.

41
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:54,257
What?

42
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,717
Why not?

43
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,053
-She's my friend.
-You like her?

44
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:02,932
Who do you think you are?
You're making us look bad.

45
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,643
No...

46
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,104
That's not what I mean.

47
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,648
That's not what I mean...

48
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,318
So-eun...

49
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:16,779
I feel sorry for her.

50
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:19,490
Your dad working for Baekyeon
was all a lie?

51
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,202
Heard you're an orphan.
What a liar.

52
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,123
Hey, there's Ja-eun.

53
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,459
Ja-eun, come and play!

54
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,502
Over here, Ja-eun!

55
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,296
Come on!

56
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,050
Ja-eun, let's play.

57
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,651
So, that's why you've
been tormenting her?

58
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,069
No.

59
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,827
-No?
-No.

60
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,538
That's not why.

61
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,340
Is that...?

62
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:22,011
Oxycodone.
It's okay.

63
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,263
I'll still be conscious
for another five minutes.

64
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,602
Spit it out. What do you think
you're doing? Spit it out, now.

65
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,856
I'll forget what
you did with this.

66
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,693
After all, you were only nine,

67
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:39,654
and a coward.

68
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,159
Besides,

69
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,870
anyone would have probably
done the same thing.

70
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,713
Then, Ja-eun, what do you think
you did that was so wrong?

71
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,470
Last year, by the stairs
of the main building.

72
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,888
Last year?

73
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,998
Ja-eun, we have
to get out of here.

74
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,584
Come on, let's go.

75
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,544
You. Shut up, and come on.

76
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,113
So-eun!

77
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,458
Fire, fire! Roll out, roll out.

00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,295

83
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,931
I was scared.

84
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,351
The closer I got to you guys,

85
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,771
I was afraid you'd find out.

86
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,653
I'm sorry.

87
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,532
For what?

88
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:33,828
For not being
just a victim like you thought.

89
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,540
I tried to help Ji-ae
and the others

90
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,252
because of what I did back then.

91
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,629
Because I regretted my actions.

92
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,047
It's okay.

93
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,550
You were only a bystander.

94
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:50,386
You didn't do
the actual bullying.

95
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,097
And that makes it okay?

96
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,563
I'm not so sure.

97
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:03,858
Remember what you said?

98
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,446
You asked if it was okay if you
didn't actually hurt anyone.

99
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,870
I'm looking for Myeong Ja-eun...

100
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,872
Ja-eun!

101
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,750
Let me take a look at you.
You're not hurt anywhere?

102
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,168
Look at me.

103
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,342
-Nothing hurts?
-No.

104
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:31,260
-Really?
-Yes.

105
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,474
I already know
that you leaked this to the press

106
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,309
so don't try to deny it.

107
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,103
How dare you sell out Baekyeon?

108
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,940
Were you always this stupid?

109
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,443
My daughter is about to lose
her spot at the university

110
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,695
both I and her
grandfather went to.

111
00:08:50,529 --> 00:08:52,073
I have nothing to lose.

112
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,367
Don't you understand?

113
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,163
You're not a
priority for me either.

00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,137
A fire broke out at Sky House?

118
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,557
Wait.

119
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,559
Who was there?

120
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,814
I'll get back to you.

121
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,486
This is Choi Ie-hwa.

122
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:32,822
There's something you need
to do for me, Principal Im.

123
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,741
The high school girl "S"
who pretended to be the victim

124
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,535
is currently an arson suspect.

125
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,869
Shockingly, the victim

126
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,663
is believed to be
the heiress of Baekyeon.

127
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,041
When I first saw this video "S"
didn't seem like a victim at all.

128
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,335
It was clear she
had the upper hand.

129
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,129
Honestly,
I could feel her arrogance.

Oh, please.

144
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:36,594
That woman set up a hidden
camera in the girls' classroom!

145
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,722
She's very dangerous.

146
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,140
The perpetrator?

147
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,726
Actually, I think
everyone is a victim.

148
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,228
I was so stressed out that day

149
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,147
and really scared.

150
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,067
Even my grades dropped.

151
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,446
I heard the school
was transferring Kim Da-yeon out.

152
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,199
She was the problem, not us.

Oh, one more thing.

Her father is in

00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:21,722

A trainee at Mega.

166
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,783
IM YE-RIM MENTIONED BY "S" IN
VIDEO, YOU WERE A LOW-LIFE TOO

167
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,284
IM YE-RIM'S TRUE COLORS

168
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,578
Myeong Ja-eun had
the worst attitude.

169
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,455
She hardly ever came to class.

170
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,625
And she always looked like
she'd been fighting.

171
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,335
She got a lot of penalties too.

172
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,130
It got so bad I told her not
to hang around at school.

173
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,632
I thought she was the bully.

174
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,972
This is unbelievable.

175
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,330
Can you understand Ha-rin?

176
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,096
I'm Detective Han Ji-min.

177
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,947
We need her to come with us...

178
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,584
What did Ha-rin say?

179
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,670
What did she say
to the two of you?

180
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,509
This is the place.

181
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,762
Where the Pyramid Game
all began.

182
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,776
We are going to play a game.

183
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,945
If you do well,
you'll get a prize,

184
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,448
but if you don't,
you'll get a penalty.

185
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:33,789
Who do we have to impress
the most when we meet them?

186
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,583
Raise your hand if you know.

187
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,341
Well done.

188
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,135
Thank you.

189
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,137
Eat up.

190
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,726
So-eun, you didn't get
a lot of points at the game.

191
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,812
You won't be getting a blanket
later when you go to bed.

192
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,480
If you don't do well next time,

193
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,899
I'll give that blouse
to someone else.

194
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,401
Do you understand?

195
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,995
That's how
she came up with the game.

196
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,750
FINALS ARE OVER!
STUDY PERIOD!

197
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,842
The cops took Su-ji
away just now.

198
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,844
What the heck is going on?

199
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:54,453
This lighter is thought
to have started the fire.

200
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,083
Have you seen it before?

201
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:03,796
Yes, it's Ha-rin's.

202
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:16,433
Cho-rong.
Isn't this too mean?

203
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,559
Who cares?

204
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,897
She doesn't have a mom
or dad to tattle to anyway.

205
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,817
Right, Ja-eun?

206
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,402
That's what you said.

207
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,945
That she's an orphan.

208
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,288
No...

209
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,584
I just...

210
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:46,296
-What if I do?
-What?

211
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,759
If I have a mom and dad
can I use this too?

212
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,811
-Oh, that's right.
-What?

213
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,980
Chairman Byeon's son
and his wife in the U.S.

214
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,565
don't have kids.

215
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,817
I think they might adopt
one of the children here.

216
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,736
That would be amazing.

217
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,613
If they adopt, they could
make a huge contribution.

218
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,781
That'd be great.

219
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,242
The Chairman is coming
on Sponsors Day, right?

220
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,202
SKY HOUSE X BAEKYEON
GROUP SPONSORS DAY

221
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,016
Who's the girl
with fire in her eyes?

222
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,893
That's Yang So-eun.

223
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,645
She's in 2nd grade.

224
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:52,571
Mom!

225
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,743
Mom, can I go with you?

226
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,165
-Look.
-It's Ha-rin.

227
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,169
From now on, if there's
something you want from me,

228
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,837
just ask for money.

229
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,645
Ha-rin, you got it wrong again.

230
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,355
How many times has it been?

231
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,028
GOSPEL OF JOHN

232
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,823
She grew up so fast.

233
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,809
Goodbye.

234
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,437
Get this out of here.

235
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,024
Plant a tree or something.

236
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,150
Yes, Mother.

237
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,943
I'll call the gardener.

238
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,571
It's okay.
If you did something wrong,

239
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,782
apologize, no matter
how late it is.

240
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,327
I'll go with you.
Don't worry, Ja-eun.

241
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,789
Okay.

242
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,503
What?

243
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,048
I'm with my friends.
I'm fine.

244
00:20:58,173 --> 00:20:59,591
Your mom?

245
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:08,475
Yes, I'll be home soon.

246
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,562
We're all minors here.

247
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,023
No wonder they're worried.

248
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,942
I can't believe Su-ji got
called in for questioning.

249
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,695
Seong Su-ji,
what an extreme life.

250
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,448
What about you?

251
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:27,744
I'm supposed to go to the
station with my mom this weekend.

252
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,873
Baekyeon is trying to
change the issue.

253
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:35,377
What if Su-ji ends up
taking the fall for everything?

254
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,671
Don't get me started.

255
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,174
What are we going to do?

256
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,886
Nothing?

257
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:55,897
Come on, focus!

258
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,695
I choose...
See that woman in black?

259
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,948
Her articles are
all about the facts.

260
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,035
Uh, excuse me...

261
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,662
Are you reporter Kang Seon-yu?

262
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,247
I'm a total fan.

263
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,916
I subscribe to your articles.

264
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,334
Do you want to see?

265
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,086
-Awesome, right?
-Thanks.

266
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,338
You're much prettier in person.

267
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,508
You base your articles on facts.

268
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:35,854
Hello, I'm Im Ye-rim.

269
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:40,275
There's something I need
to tell you before it's too late.

270
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,283
I will not be debuting.

271
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,204
I, Im Ye-rim, also took part
in the Pyramid Game that

272
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,122
took place in Class 2-5
at Baekyeon High.

273
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:55,999
I'm surprised.

274
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,293
I didn't expect you to reach out.

275
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:01,963
I'm passing the buck to you.

276
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,217
I was on a video call

277
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:09,096
with my boyfriend
one day in September.

278
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,651
Su-ji, is this really you?

279
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,152
Why didn't you tell me?

280
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,196
I'm sorry you had
to go through this.

281
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:28,573
See?

282
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,450
This is the annex.

283
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,161
Nice building, right?
It's even nicer inside.

284
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,163
My class is in the main building.

285
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,082
-What's that over there?
-Huh?

286
00:23:37,165 --> 00:23:38,542
What?

287
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,170
Oh, it's the girls.

288
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,172
Class five?

289
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,715
I have to go.

290
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:49,094
What are they doing?

291
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,686
Let's get it over with
before PE is over.

292
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,773
Damn it.

293
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,071
Does it hurt? Does it?

294
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,491
It's your own fault
for being an F.

295
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,084
We could give you a chance.

296
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:25,172
If you don't like this,
you could take something instead.

297
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:27,465
An oxy.

298
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:35,015
LIT TEACHER

299
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,187
Have you seen it?
Are you okay?

300
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,563
What's going on?

301
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,774
Apparently, Ms. Choi
kept that video all this time.

302
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,530
You know, at this point, I'm just
grateful she didn't delete it.

303
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,375
This is the truth behind Class
2-5 of Baekyeon Girls' High.

304
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,091
This is the truth behind Class
2-5 of Baekyeon Girls' High.

305
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,433
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
I WAS THE OFFICIAL OUTCAST

306
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,352
OF CLASS 2-5,
A VICTIM AND BYSTANDER

307
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,022
ME TOO

308
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,903
I was also a bystander.

309
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:32,781
I took part in the game

310
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:36,117
by being a bystander
to the bullying.

311
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:41,122
I was a bystander
to the Pyramid Game too.

312
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,791
I WAS ALSO A BYSTANDER

313
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:46,419
I WAS ALSO A BYSTANDER

314
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,843
I'm so glad
Su-ji is okay now.

315
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,138
-What about you?
-What about me?

316
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,974
It's not okay for you.

317
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,476
You're really not going to debut?

318
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,602
No.

319
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,522
I've already apologized
to the agency and to the members.

320
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,816
I can't debut anyway.

321
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,442
It all came out.

322
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,153
There, I'm done.

323
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:13,947
MISS YOU, FRIEND

324
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,241
I'm gonna send a DM.

325
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,827
-To who?
-To my friend.

326
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,338
MISS YOU, FRIEND

327
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,551
What's wrong?

328
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,969
Oh...

329
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:39,055
Ye-rim...
Ye-rim...

330
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:43,059
She called me a friend.

331
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,326
Would that...

332
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,662
For Ye-Ye-rim...

333
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,664
Would that help

334
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,710
-Ye-rim?
-No.

335
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:13,506
It'd help you.
I read a study

336
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,676
and apparently, sharing
experiences with other people

337
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,179
can help victims
ease their trauma.

338
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,139
I, I'll...

339
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,184
Do it.

340
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,146
You can give it some more
thought before you decide.

341
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,398
It'll be good...

342
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:32,984
for me, and...

343
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,695
It would help

344
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,907
Ye-rim too.

345
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,160
Ye-rim... She...

346
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,996
She helped me.
She was the only one.

347
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,419
She helped me.

348
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,673
I want to do it.

349
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,592
Seung-hwa.

350
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,347
Then, just remember this.

351
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:07,227
-You did nothing wrong.
-I know.

352
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,106
I ran into Ha-rin that day.

353
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,691
-What?
-At the festival.

354
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,397
What did you do that to me?

355
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,359
What did you do that to me?

356
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:58,653
Why was I the F?

357
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,158
You...

358
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,328
Stepped on my foot by mistake.

359
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:31,186
She said it was because
I had stepped on her foot.

360
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,110
And after I told the teacher,

361
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,993
I was given a penalty,

362
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,414
and had to do a strip show.

363
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:57,420
I was so scared
they'd post it online,

364
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,561
I couldn't even tell my parents.

365
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:25,782
Doesn't seem like a lie.

366
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,534
Dang, that's so sad.

367
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,911
Bullied for stepping on her foot
by mistake? That's insane.

368
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,204
She's definitely a psycho.

369
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,331
A strip show?
Are they crazy?

370
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,708
She said Im Ye-rim
was the only one who helped her.

371
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,085
Hang in there, Wu-ri.

372
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,795
We're sorry.

373
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,925
She said

374
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,596
it was because
I had stepped on her foot.

375
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,308
JA-EUN

376
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:55,895
Hello?

377
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,605
I just remembered.

378
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,774
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

379
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,150
I remember now.

380
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,194
The day by the stairs
in the main building last year.

381
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,909
So-eun!

382
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,040
ONE YEAR AGO

383
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,043
It's you, right?

384
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,254
Do you remember me?

385
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,382
I'm Ja-eun, from
Haneulbyeol Elementary.

386
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,303
Myeong Ja-eun.

387
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:31,222
It's been ages.

388
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,807
How have you been?

389
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,642
How do I look?

390
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:41,482
You look well.

391
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,735
I'm glad.

392
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:47,614
I really am.

393
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,457
Ja-eun!

394
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,795
Let's talk more next time.
I'm sorry.

395
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:24,067
Last year, by the stairs
in the main building.

396
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,110
Last year?

397
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:27,945
You forgave
yourself for something

398
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,197
I didn't forgive you for.

399
00:32:29,322 --> 00:32:31,824
All the guilt vanished
from your face,

400
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,035
and it made me
want to rip it apart.

401
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,953
That's why I made you the F.

402
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,747
For something you
could never imagine.

403
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,333
I wanted to torment you
until the day you died.

404
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,965
Why are you looking
at me like that?

405
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,679
Why? Do you understand me
a little now?

406
00:32:56,974 --> 00:32:59,227
You are one crazy bitch.

407
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,229
-What?
-You heard me.

408
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,939
You're crazy.

409
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,232
Ja-eun.

410
00:33:04,357 --> 00:33:05,358
Am I the only one
disgusted by her

411
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:06,275
blaming everyone
else but herself?

412
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,902
That's one hell of
a rationalization

413
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,362
and you shifting the
blame makes me sick.

414
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:11,614
All your self-pity makes me
want to barf.

415
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,991
You know nothing.

416
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:16,869
Why do I even have to?

417
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,455
Don't pretend
that you've been wronged.

418
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,249
Nothing would've
changed even if she had

419
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,625
gotten down on
her knees that day.

420
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,586
You may have taken an oxy but
at least get the timeline right.

421
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,172
You were already bullying
Wu-ri by that point.

422
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,091
A crazy bitch did
all sorts of crazy shit

423
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,968
and now that
you're backed into a corner

424
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,928
you're saying you
were a victim too?

425
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,764
That's so pathetic.

426
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,226
A victim of bullying?

427
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,186
So?

428
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,814
Does the sob story of being
an orphan and a victim

429
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:46,941
change the fact that you
played the Pyramid Game?

430
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,110
As Yang So-eun or Baek Ha-rin,

431
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,488
you had a chance.
A chance at redemption.

432
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,657
The person who ruined that

433
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,951
wasn't Ja-eun, but you.

434
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,163
You can't forgive Ja-eun
anymore anyhow. Why?

435
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:02,165
Because now

436
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,500
you're the bully.

437
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:09,422
Live the rest of your life
being ashamed of what you did.

438
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,300
That's what Ja-eun
is doing at least.

439
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,312
So-eun.

440
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,987
Even so...

441
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:37,700
I'm sorry I didn't ask you
to play with me.

442
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:43,206
I'm sorry
I forgot all about it so easily.

443
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,758
I'm so, so sorry.

444
00:34:58,429 --> 00:34:59,806
Shut up!

445
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:05,186
I told you,
watch what happens to me.

446
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:19,200
You'll remember this day
for a long, long time.

447
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,586
What is that?

448
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,171
A fire?

449
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,217
You just can't stop...

450
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,427
Ja-eun, we have
to get out of here.

451
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:40,137
Come on, let's go.

452
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,640
You. Shut up, and come on.

453
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,251
So-eun!

454
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,430
Anyone here?

455
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,765
Fire department!
Call out!

456
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,221
Hey.

457
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,642
Oh, this?

458
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:11,520
The test we actually took and the
test that was on Mr. Im's laptop.

459
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,148
Only question 17 is different.

460
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,528
17?

461
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,989
Question 17 was
added later, right?

462
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,458
Class exists everywhere.

463
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:34,502
School is a smaller
version of society.

464
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,170
In society, different classes...

465
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:40,883
Would you still say that even
if it makes an F want to die?

466
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,469
I'm saying that it could be
hell for someone.

467
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,439
I think I've found it.

468
00:37:58,484 --> 00:37:59,944
What are you doing?

469
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:09,453
Su-ji.

470
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,163
Yes?

471
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:17,461
I saw the interview

472
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,256
one of your men gave.

473
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,799
I'm sorry.

474
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:23,843
I misunderstood.

475
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,476
Su-ji.

476
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,027
The reason I went to your
school on Parents' Day

477
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:46,073
was because I was never involved
in your school activities.

478
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,243
You were always so independent,

479
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,746
and dependable.

480
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,333
But before you became
an adult and left home,

481
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,089
I wanted to see...

482
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:08,429
how you were doing
in your new school,

483
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:14,143
and meet your friends.

484
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,943
I'm doing well and behaving.

485
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,403
Oh, come on.

486
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,412
Don't worry.

487
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,457
I'm okay now.

488
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,794
I'm sorry.

489
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,264
I'm sorry.

490
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,478
Oh, I just got a text.

491
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,527
Found the contract.

492
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,153
Your homeroom teacher was nowhere
near qualified to be hired.

493
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,989
Fortunately, the system
kept records of copied files.

494
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,491
It left records of the test

495
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,576
being copied to a
USB stick several times.

496
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,704
Tests being leaked,
and unfair hiring practices.

497
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,039
This will be more than enough.

498
00:40:17,164 --> 00:40:18,499
All we have to do
is raise doubts.

499
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,000
Then, I'm posting this.

500
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,502
Yes.

00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,171
CONTROVERSIAL BY GIRLS' HIGH

502
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,006
SCHOOL BULLYING +
UNFAIR HIRING PRACTICE

503
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,633
UNFAIR HIRING PRACTICE
+ TEST LEAKS

504
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:33,848
Are you okay?

505
00:40:33,973 --> 00:40:34,932
About what?

506
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,809
Don't feel bad.

507
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:39,353
Bullies are bullies.

508
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,023
By the way,
where did you get

509
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,859
the bullying incident reports?

510
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,533
Reporter Kang Seon-yu?

511
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,161
I'm the one who called,
Yun Na-hee.

512
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,371
I have a lot to tell you

513
00:40:57,454 --> 00:41:00,249
about Baekyeon
Girls' High School.

514
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,668
BULLYING INCIDENT REPORTERS

515
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,046
RESTRICTED AREA IN ANNEX AND HOURS

516
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,298
STUDENTS ASSIGNED
TO CLASS 1-5, 2022

517
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,425
This is finally
coming out into the open.

518
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,597
When did you start planning this?

519
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,600
When you asked
me to keep it safe?

520
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,727
The day you were fired?

521
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,146
I just had a vague idea then...

522
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,689
I see...

523
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,986
I'm sure I disappointed
you that day.

524
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,363
You girls

525
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,783
are so amazing.

526
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,744
I've learned a lot from you.

527
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,913
You're the one who taught us.

528
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,874
You told us not to lose.

529
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,501
That Ha-rin and we

530
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,421
were all just the same
high school students.

531
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,840
I don't know why,

532
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,509
but those words encouraged me.

533
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,430
Thanks.

534
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,392
Now, leave the rest up to me.

535
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,145
This time, I won't let you down.

536
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,940
All right.

537
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:18,285
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

538
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,412
SEARCH WARRANT

539
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:21,956
We have a search warrant

540
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,458
issued by the
Seoul Central District Court.

541
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,502
Start the search.

542
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,801
-Get all the papers.
-Yes, sir.

543
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,262
Don't forget
the USB sticks either.

544
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,542
Where's Da-yeon?

545
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,929
You piece of shit!

546
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,685
You bitch!

547
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,526
What if she's a psychopath?

548
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:33,986
Keep it down.

549
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:36,071
That's why we're doing the test.

550
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,198
You should've known when she
started that nonsense about

551
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,076
going to art school and asking
us to buy designer hand bags!

552
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:44,163
How dare you come back
to this sacred judo gym?

553
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:48,876
You were expelled.
That means you're disqualified

554
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,544
from entering
the national competition.

555
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,212
Don't think this is unfair.

556
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,923
You threw away
everything yourself.

557
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,634
Good luck at your trial.

558
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,181
ASSEMBLYMAN
JEONG HONG-GIL STEPS DOWN

559
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,432
DUE TO DAUGHTER'S BULLYING
AND GRADE TAMPERING

560
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,143
This is so unfair!

561
00:44:06,643 --> 00:44:09,021
I didn't do any of the bullying!

562
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:12,149
But why I am being expelled?

563
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,571
She's a bitch too.

564
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:18,822
She's just the same.

565
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,574
Her name is Park Ji-young.
She lives in Baneo-dong.

566
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:21,867
Baneo-dong? Okay.

567
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,285
-Revenge challenge on?
- It's on.

568
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,746
Shit... Damn it...

569
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,415
Then, should I have
gotten beaten up instead?

570
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,084
I'm a victim too.

571
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:33,837
I did not bully anyone or cheat!

572
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:38,258
Change the admission criteria
to Hanguk University!

573
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,761
I DID NOT BULLY ANYONE OR CHEAT

574
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:53,857
NOTIFICATION OF

SEO DO-AH, EXPELLED BASED ON
ARTICLE 17, PARAGRAPH 1-9

576
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:05,452
It feels weird.

577
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,496
I thought I'd be relieved,

578
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:11,333
but I don't know...
I just feel weird.

579
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:14,837
Maybe it's because
the boss is missing?

580
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,463
Baek Ha-rin.

581
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,095
Do-ah?

582
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,890
What are you doing here?

583
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,200
You've been expelled
just like the others.

584
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,662
Are you okay?

585
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:53,333
It's the consequence
of my mistakes.

586
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,252
Still, in the end,

587
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,379
you stepped over that line.

588
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,592
Thanks for saying that.

589
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,934
Do you like it?

590
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,146
It's my first time
trying something like this.

591
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:16,857
It's good.

592
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,295
We have to talk.

593
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,047
Why did you do it?

594
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,007
Do you have any idea what you lost

595
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,926
over your pathetic
sense of justice?

596
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,053
Get ready to study abroad.

597
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,264
-Get back on track.
-I'm going to take the GED.

598
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,391
Despite the fact
that my choices of schools

599
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,393
will be limited because of the
red line in my student record.

600
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,063
Seo Do-ah. You shouldn't have
deviated from your position.

601
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,774
-Those are the rules.
-I didn't deviate.

602
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:01,735
I just have more room
to move now, that's all.

603
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,447
The circle I drew around me
has grown.

604
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,409
And Dad,

605
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,287
I know you saved Director Choi's
number under my name,

606
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:14,331
and that you're having
an affair with her.

607
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,917
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

608
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,710
What are you talking about?

609
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,546
I think you're the one

610
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,047
who broke the rules.

611
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:29,096
We never officially
did a psychopath test on her,

612
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:33,267
but right after we adopted her,
we knew that she was different.

613
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,185
Although we weren't
her biological parents,

614
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,604
we did everything we could
to do our duty.

615
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:39,940
However, we can no longer
defend her actions

616
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:41,275
that greatly harm society,

617
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,778
and we're now in the process
of dissolving the adoption.

618
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:47,281
The truth about her roots
has been disclosed,

619
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,157
as well as the fact that
we're dissolving the adoption.

620
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,701
This time,

621
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,288
I won't act foolish.

622
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:01,962
WHO WILL SAVE ME

623
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,554
I apologize once again

624
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:15,684
to the entire country
for these past events.

625
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,234
As a way to to apologize,

626
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,194
Baekyeon Group will suspend

627
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,532
all its work in education.

628
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,826
We will choose a foundation
that can provide

629
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:34,328
a good environment
and policies...

630
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,829
Drink this.

631
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,626
We hope that this decision
has a positive impact on...

632
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:42,252
Are you okay?

633
00:48:42,836 --> 00:48:45,130
You look like you have
a lot on your mind.

634
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:50,552
You never answered my question.

635
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,679
Can you understand Ha-rin?

636
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,647
No, I can't. But...

637
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:05,859
What I did was wrong.

638
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,695
I shouldn't have ignored
what was happening to her.

639
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,784
Ignore...

640
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:22,793
I've been thinking.
And I still can't understand her.

641
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,503
I don't even pity her.

642
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:26,546
She said she blamed you
when you met her again,

643
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,757
but she still made a
game and built a castle

644
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:30,384
surrounded by bystanders like you.

645
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,177
Ultimately,

646
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:34,721
it's just the excuse of a bully.

647
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:46,066
BAEKYEON GROUP'S ADOPTED CHILD
WAS A PSYCHOPATH

648
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,407
I KNEW IT, SHE WAS A PSYCHO
NO WONDER

649
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,909
I GET IT NOW.
SHE'S JUST A DIFFERENT SPECIES

650
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,829
I'M SO RELIEVED

651
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:09,381
PATIENT
NO FAMILY

652
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:20,726
That's Ha-rin's punishment.

653
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,895
Indifference and neglect.

654
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,148
She's trapped.

655
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,609
No one wonders about her,

656
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,361
or goes to see her.

657
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:35,949
From the moment
she opens her eyes,

658
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:38,952
she'll be in hell.

659
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,505
Right now!

660
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,132
Are you happy?

661
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,635
But...

662
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:13,904
BAEKYEON GROUP LEAVES
EDUCATION BUSINESS

663
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,489
AND BECOMES LEADING
ELECTRONICS COMPANY

664
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:31,755
A little more strength.

665
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,508
Yes, slowly.

666
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:39,387
A little more.

667
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,642
Eun-jeong!

668
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:04,538
Hey, people might think
we're bullying you.

669
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,747
Move it!

670
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:27,894
I was...

671
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,400
A bystander too.

672
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:09,519
2 MONTHS LATER

673
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,818
Hi, guys.

674
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,282
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

675
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:23,742
Wow.

676
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,493
You're not busy?

677
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,829
I'm super busy.

678
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,124
I need a break.

679
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,505
Muscles are the future.

680
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,135
But I can't live without
my bias either.

681
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:46,139
Gross. Get off me.
I hate it when you do that.

682
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:49,768
Hey!
That's so mean...

683
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,479
I didn't know you had it in you.

684
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:55,065
Say that again.
Say it like you mean it!

685
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,816
Just swear!

686
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,527
Winter break is too short.

687
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,071
It's way too short!

688
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,282
By the way, I heard they're
renaming the school.

689
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,160
I'm sure it'll be
something really mundane again.

690
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:10,956
Hey, Ye-rim, are you sure
about gulping that down?

691
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,749
Don't you have to
watch your weight?

692
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,501
I saw on Mega Hit's homepage

693
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,628
that your members
are debuting next week.

694
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,464
You could start again.

695
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:22,842
Yeah, I read the comments
and people still like you.

696
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,095
There were only a
few mean comments.

697
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,513
It's okay.

698
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,515
You really won't regret it?

699
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,856
I deserve some sort
of penalty at least.

700
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,777
Even if I didn't do anything,

701
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:45,073
I may have hurt someone
because of that.

702
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,617
So I just have to deal with it.

703
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,954
I got to perform anyway.
At the festival.

704
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,331
Wasn't I super cool?

705
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,544
You were super cool.

706
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,340
Anyway, we're seniors now.

707
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:04,551
You just had to bring that up?

708
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,136
You're making me dizzy.

709
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:08,930
I think I have senioritis.

710
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:11,558
Wu-ri is prepping for the GED.

711
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:13,852
By the way,
where's Wu-ri's brother?

712
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,400
He enlisted.

713
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,781
Wanna trade with a gimbap?

714
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:28,533
Go with the other smurfs.

715
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,118
It's my treat with
my last paycheck.

716
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:31,327
FREE PASS

717
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,746
Worldly possessions should
be left behind when enlisting.

718
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,164
You're joining the army?

719
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,794
Tell me the truth since I won't
be seeing you for a while.

720
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,213
-You're crazy, right?
-So are you.

721
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,925
Thanks for this.
See you in two years.

722
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,434
-When do you want to go?
-Oh, wow.

723
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,852
Tomorrow!
Let's go tomorrow!

724
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,395
Wow, where did you get this?

725
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,106
-What about cram school?
-Just skip it!

726
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,608
-We have to study!
-Just skip it, skip it!

727
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,818
-That's not important.
-Skip it, skip it, skip it!

728
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,570
-Wow.
-Wow.

729
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,580
Su-ji.

730
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,792
If you run into any problems...

731
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:21,086
I know, I'll get into
the habit of overcoming them.

732
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,296
You can tell me anytime.

733
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:24,714
Even if you change
your mind about

734
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,174
transferring schools,
you can tell me.

735
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,885
Whenever.

736
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:30,929
I'm not going to a new school.

737
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,932
I'm going to graduate from
here with my friends.

738
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,602
See you later!

739
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,482
You're going to be late.

740
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,483
Hurry up.

741
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:46,027
Hey, you seniors.

742
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,489
Chin up.

743
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,453
Go on in.

744
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:56,704
And straighten up!

745
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,206
Yes, ma'am!

746
00:57:02,001 --> 00:57:05,588
NEW HEART, NEW MEANING,
NEW NAME, NEW FOUNDATION

747
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,383
WELCOME, MIRYO GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

748
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,518
HARD WORK NEVER BETRAYS!
WE ARE CHEERING FOR YOUR FUTURE

749
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:21,521
-Hi.
-Hi.

750
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,692
Let's walk over to cram school
together after school.

751
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,402
Are you going to apply for both

752
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:28,820
liberal arts
and science subjects?

753
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:30,572
Just liberal arts.

754
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:31,781
Huh? Why?

755
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:33,366
Take science classes with me!

756
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,367
Sheesh!

757
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:36,536
You'll be seeing her
at lunch later anyway.

758
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:37,745
You can talk then.

759
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,122
Don't make my senioritis
flair up so early in the morning.

760
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,040
It's always the ones
who get low grades

761
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,292
who take 200 extra classes.

762
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,586
Oops.

763
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,671
You're so annoying.

764
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:50,550
Hey, doesn't Eun-jeong
have a meet today?

765
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:52,802
Really?
Why didn't you go?

766
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,054
You should go
and cheer her on like this.

767
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,639
I'm your...

768
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,141
I'm your...

769
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,601
I'm...

770
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:01,895
Your...

771
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:05,356
Goddess of victory, whoo!

772
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,067
What's up with those moves?
Try this.

773
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,861
Goddess of victory!

774
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,071
Whoo!
Whoo!

775
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,907
Whoo!
How did you do that?

776
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,035
How did you do that?

777
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,661
You're awesome.

778
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,079
See you.

779
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:31,758
Ja-eun, hi.

780
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,551
Hi.

781
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:38,765
Oh yeah.

782
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,059
I heard the girls from
Miryo Group are coming today.

783
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,102
-Miryo Group?
-The twins?

784
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,730
What are they like?
Who knows?

785
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,774
SENIOR TEACHERS' OFFICE

786
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:49,484
2025 COLLEGE
ENTRANCE EXAM SCHEDULE

787
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:56,407
Hey, what was the game

788
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,826
that Baek Ha-rin played
at this school?

789
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:00,787
HEY, WHAT WAS THE GAME THAT BAEK
HA-RIN PLAYED AT THIS SCHOOL?

790
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:04,791
The Pyramid Game?

791
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,044
Sounds fun, doesn't it?

792
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,129
Game on?

793
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,718
It's on.

794
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,160
Hi, I'm Seong Su-ji.

795
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:44,580
PYRAMID GAME

796
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:51,421
THE 13TH PYRAMID GAME
